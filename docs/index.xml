  <title>When might there be a diversity-merit tradeoff?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This morning I was reading <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2024.2423358">this paper</a> (sorry I’m too lazy to set up a bibliography file on top of the simulation), which quotes a researcher raising a familiar argument against diversity efforts:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We start employing people based on any criteria other than competency, well, then, of course we’re going to get a … A … A poorer outcome. Competency should be … Ability should be the sole criterion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To adjust the terminology slightly, according to this argument there’s a tradeoff between diversity and merit, such that if we take contributions to diversity into account (in hiring, research awards, tenure, etc.) the result will be an overall loss of “merit” or “quality”.</p>
<p>As the scare quotes suggest, there are some fundamental conceptual problem with this argument. No one knows what the hell “merit” is, much less how to accurately measure it when making decisions about hiring, etc.; and at best it can mean a wide variety of things, and indeed among these things might be contributions to diversity.</p>
<p>But in this post I want to consider instead the tradeoff assumption itself. If we grant to the conservative<sup>1</sup> that there is such a thing as “merit,” that it can be accurately measured, it has a unidimensional structure, and that maximizing it is among the most important goals of hiring, it still doesn’t necessarily follow that giving increased weight to diversity (also assumed to be accurately measurable and unidimensional) will significantly reduce merit. Under some circumstances it might do so; but if, say, merit and diversity are correlated, it might not make much of a difference.</p>
<p>So my question here is not <em>whether</em> there’s a diversity-merit tradeoff, but <em>under what conditions</em> there’s a tradeoff.</p>
<section id="defining-the-simulation" class="level1">
<h1>Defining the simulation</h1>
<p>To investigate question of the conditions for a diversity-merit tradeoff, we’ll set up a very simple simulation of a hiring scenario. We’ll need the following packages:</p>

<p>We start with a pool of potential researchers, each of whom has a merit score and a (contributions to) diversity score. For simplicity, each score will follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. But merit and diversity might be correlated, so we’ll use a multivariate Gaussian, with the correlation coefficient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho">/<code>rho</code> as one parameter that can be adjusted in the simulation. This will range from 1 (perfect correlation between diversity and merit: the meritorious are also the “most diversity”) to -1 (perfect <em>anti</em>correlation between diversity and merit: the meritorious are the “least diverse”). In <code>simulate</code> below, this step is accomplished by the nested function <code>draw_pool</code>.</p>
<p>To hire out of the pool, we next calculate a score for each individual in the pool, a weighted sum of merit and diversity:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%20%5Ctextrm%7Bscore%7D_%5Calpha%20=%20%5Calpha%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ctextrm%7Bdiversity%7D%20+%20(1%20-%20%7C%5Calpha%7C)%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ctextrm%7Bmerit%7D%20"> We’ll consider weights ranging from 1 (only considering diversity) to 0 (only considering merit) and down to -1 (which amounts to discriminating against diversity, without any consideration for merit).<sup>2</sup> This step is done using <code>score_pool</code> below.</p>
<p>The top individuals, by score, will be hired. We’ll consider three different hiring scenarios, where the top 10%, 25%, and 50% are hired. You can think of this as “selectivity,” but I’m thinking of it as “austerity.” While we expect average merit to be greater under greater selectivity, it also means there are many fewer researchers hired, and consequently probably much less research “productivity.”</p>
<p>We’ll look at two outputs from this simulation: mean merit, and “productivity.” We’ll operationalize the latter as the sum of merit across the hired researchers.</p>
<p>These final steps — hiring the top researchers from the pool and calculating their mean merit and productivity — are done by the <code>hire</code> function.</p>
<p>A single iteration of the simulation is handled by the following function:</p>

<p>(To take advantage of <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/07/purrr-1-1-0-parallel/"><code>purrr</code>’s new parallelization feature</a>, we need to nest the functions for each step inside <code>simulate</code>, and reference package functions using <code>::</code> syntax.)</p>

<p>First, high austerity tends to heighten the effects of diversity weighting (or not): the difference between the maximum and minimum values of mean merit is greatest when only the top 10% are hired, and smallest when the top 50% are hired. Second, within a hiring level, mean merit appears to be maximized when diversity is given zero weight. Third, the effect of weighting diversity depends on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho">, the correlation between merit and diversity. When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho%20%3E%200">, then positively weighting diversity doesn’t appear to diminish mean merit very much; while discrimination decreases it sharply.</p>
<p>Let’s plot “transects,” mean merit against diversity for moderate values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-0.4%20%5Cleq%20%5Crho%20%5Cleq%200.4">. We’ll go ahead and include every iteration, and GAM curves across values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho">.</p>

<p>These confirm that more extreme weightings of diversity do indeed have less dramatic effects when they’re aligned with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho">. There’s also a “plateau,” roughly independent of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho"> and for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-0.25%20%3C%20%5Calpha%20%3C%200.25">. Giving some weight to diversity, but placing more weight on merit, has negligible effects on mean merit.</p>
<p>It also looks like, for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho%20=%200.4">, mean merit might not be maximized right at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20=%200">. Let’s zoom in on this area, and let each panel have its own y-axis scale.</p>

<li>the proposal involves treating diversity as about as important as merit, if not more so (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20%5Cgg%200.25">).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve added a moderate version of these conditions as arrow A on the figure. This does correspond to a notable drop in mean merit, especially under austere hiring (or when we’re only considering the “top researchers”).</p>
<p>The contrasting “DEI argument” is strongest when</p>
<ul>
<li>the status quo is discriminatory (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20%3C%200">)</li>
<li>diversity and merit are strongly correlated (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho%20%5Cgg%200">)</li>
<li>the proposal involves giving diversity some positive weight, but still placing more weight on merit (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%20%3C%20%5Calpha%20%3C%200.25">).</li>
</ul>
<p>This corresponds to something like arrow B. Under these conditions, mean merit actually increases, as “diverse” researchers are no longer discriminated against.</p>
<p>It’s striking to me how well this oversimplified model brings out the way our society talks about diversity. The conservative view — generally dominant over the last half century or so — assumes that we’ve already achieved a color-blind ideal, that diverse scholars are eo ipso worse researchers, that the proposal is to all but completely ignore any considerations of merit, and that we’re primarily interested in the “top researchers” or operating under such severe austerity that very few candidates will make the cut. While the contrasting view assumes that discrimination still exists, that “more diverse” researchers are better researchers (perhaps because diversity is considered <em>part</em> of merit), and modestly proposes to give diversity some weight while still emphasizing merit.</p>

<h1>Executive summary</h1>
<p>The UC Merced administration is working to develop a set of “principles and metrics” to be used to make or inform the allocation of faculty lines to departments. This document provides a review of the limitations and problems associated with using publication-based metrics (bibliometrics) for faculty resource allocation decisions. Drawing on my work experience in research evaluation and the established consensus among professionals in that field, I argue that bibliometrics are not fit for purpose for making hiring, tenure, promotion, and faculty line allocation decisions.</p>
<section id="professional-consensus" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="professional-consensus">Professional consensus</h2>
<p>This position is consistent with major professional statements in the field of research evaluation, including the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Leiden Manifesto, both of which explicitly warn against using journal-based metrics and similar bibliometric measures for personnel decisions. DORA specifically states: “Do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.”</p>

<section id="key-technical-problems" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-technical-problems">Key technical problems</h2>
<p>I review several technical problems with bibliometrics as measures of research quality:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Proxy Limitations:</dt>
<dd>
These metrics are at best crude proxies for research quality and impact, measuring outputs and outcomes rather than actual scholarly or social impacts.
</dd>
<dt>Incommensurability:</dt>
<dd>
Different types of research outputs are fundamentally incommensurable: there is no meaningful way to compare a historical monograph to a biomedical journal article on a single scale.
</dd>
<dt>Reference Class Problem:</dt>
<dd>
Academic disciplines have porous boundaries and individual researchers typically work across multiple communities, making it impossible to accurately normalize metrics across fields.
</dd>
<dt>Data Quality Issues:</dt>
<dd>
A fundamental tradeoff exists between data coverage and quality—comprehensive databases suffer from poor data quality and manipulation vulnerabilities, while selective databases systematically underrepresent social sciences and humanities.
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="systemic-bias-concerns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systemic-bias-concerns">Systemic bias concerns</h2>
<p>Extensive research demonstrates that bibliometric systems systematically disadvantage women and racial/ethnic minorities through lower citation rates, publication barriers, and exclusionary networks. Rather than providing objective assessment, these systems risk exacerbating existing inequities.</p>
</section>
<section id="failure-to-avoid-controversy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="failure-to-avoid-controversy">Failure to avoid controversy</h2>
<p>Bibliometrics are attractive because they appear to depoliticize controversial resource allocation decisions. But this appearance is incorrect. Instead, they shift political controversies to the kinds of technical implementation issues identified above, creating new sources of institutional conflict while failing to address underlying disagreements about priorities and values.</p>
</section>
<section id="recommendations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>As an alternative to bibliometrics, I recommend taking an approach to faculty hiring decisions that starts by articulating campus-levels aims for hiring; approaches hiring requests as program impact plans — also known as theories of change and logic models — to explicitly connect proposed hires to those campus-level aims; and incorporates faculty voice through a peer review process, similar to the approaches already used for curricular changes on campus and by research funding agencies.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Since last semester, the UC Merced administration has been discussing the development of a set of “principles and metrics” to be used to make or inform the allocation of faculty lines to departments. In SSHA, faculty have participated in these discussions via meetings of the department chairs and Executive Committee, with multiple rounds of feedback on lists of proposed principles and opportunities.</p>
<p>Publication-based metrics have come up repeatedly in these discussions, with both support and criticism from various faculty members. As I explain below, I have some work experience and scholarly expertise on the uses and limitations of bibliometrics. Following the lead of professionals in the relevant fields, I do not believe these metrics are fit for purpose in making hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions, including decisions about how to allocate faculty lines.</p>
<p>In discussions and in writing, I have previously shared brief statements of common technical concerns about bibliometrics with Dean Arriola. The purpose of this document is to provide a more detailed version of these concerns, showing that they are grounded in relevant scholarship and expertise.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this introduction, I first clarify the terms “bibliometrics” and “scientometrics,” summarize my background in this area, and review two prominent statements on bibliometrics by research assessment professionals. In the following sections, I argue that bibliometrics are at best crude proxies for the things we academics are trying to do with our scholarship; that research outputs and outcomes are incommensurable in ways that violate the assumptions used to calculate bibliometrics; that bibliometrics are confounded by the “reference class problem”; that there is a sharp tradeoff between bibliometric data coverage and data quality; that bibliometrics can reflect systematic gender and racial/ethnic bias; and finally that they do not serve their broader function of quieting fraught controversies. I close with some procedural recommendations that, I think, would keep controversies from becoming too heated and avoid the favoritism and patronage of the current system.</p>
<section id="bibliometrics-and-scientometrics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bibliometrics-and-scientometrics">Bibliometrics and scientometrics</h2>
<p>Among specialists, “bibliometrics” refers to “bibliography-derived” measures of scientific productivity and impact, including publication and citation counts as well as impact factors<sup>1</sup> and the h-index<sup>2</sup>. “Scientometrics” is a more general term, covering measures based on patent citations <span class="citation" data-cites="FunkDynamicNetworkMeasure2016">(e.g., Funk and Owen-Smith 2016)</span>, coauthor network statistics <span class="citation" data-cites="ZengDifferencesCollaborationPatterns2016">(Zeng et al. 2016)</span>, semantic novelty <span class="citation" data-cites="HePredictiveEffectsNovelty2018 PetersenEvolutionBiomedicalInnovation2022">(He and Chen 2018; Petersen 2022)</span>, or indeed any other quantitative attempt to understand scientific productivity and social impact.</p>
<p>“Scientometrics” is also used as the name of a research field — the scholarly side of the practice of research assessment or research evaluation — that operates at the intersection of science and technology studies, science policy, library and information sciences, and sociology. As a research field, research evaluation/scientometrics has obvious conceptual and methodological ties to science-of-science and metascience. Unlike these other two fields, research evaluation tends to focus more on supporting decisionmaking by funding bodies and research organizations.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>From 2015-2017 I served as an AAAS Science and Technology Policy fellow, hosted by the EPA Office of Research and Development’s Chemical Safety for Sustainability program (first year) and then by NSF’s National Robotics Initiative (second year). In both positions my responsibilities included developing and conducting evaluation projects for the research done (EPA) or funded (NSF) by my host office. Two of these evaluation projects were published and appear on my CV <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksBibliometricsSocialValidation2016 HicksNationalRoboticsInitiative2019">(Daniel J. Hicks 2016; D. Hicks and Simmons 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>From 2017-2019 I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Data Science Initiative (now known as DataLab: Data Science and Informatics) at UC Davis. My position was funded by Elsevier<sup>3</sup> and the general aim of the postdoc was to develop new approaches to scientometrics that avoided common criticisms of bibliometrics (as discussed in the rest of this document). In this role I had opportunities to meet with deans and campus-level administrators to develop projects, and worked closely with both faculty and staff. Again, some of these projects were published and appear on my CV <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksImpactingCapabilitiesConceptual2018 HicksNetworkAnalysisEvaluate2019 HicksProductivityInterdisciplinaryImpacts2021">(Daniel J. Hicks, Stahmer, and Smith 2018; Daniel J. Hicks et al. 2019; Daniel J. Hicks 2021)</span>.</p>

<section id="the-dora-statement-and-leiden-manifesto" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dora-statement-and-leiden-manifesto">The DORA Statement and Leiden Manifesto</h2>
<p>Bibliometrics have played a significant and highly contested role in faculty hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions in a number of countries for several decades, though less so in the United States. In this context, research evaluation experts have released multiple statements providing guidance and criticizing certain uses of bibliometrics. I review two especially influential statements, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment <span class="citation" data-cites="CaganSanFranciscoDeclaration2013">(DORA, published in multiple venues including Cagan 2013)</span> and the Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksLeidenManifestoResearch2015">(Diana Hicks et al. 2015)</span>.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>DORA first offers a number of criticisms of the impact factor: that it was originally created to help librarians make purchasing decisions, not assess research; that means are misleading measures of central tendency for highly skewed distributions such as citation counts; that it fails to distinguish different kinds of articles (commentaries from primary research from reviews) and neglects differences across research fields; and that the data used to calculate impact factors are generally neither public nor subject to peer review. It then lists 18 recommended practices for research assessment, the first of which is</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For institutions specifically, recommendation 5 states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Leiden Manifesto is motivated by a concern that research evaluation and metric development is “usually well intentioned, not always well informed, often ill applied …. by organizations without knowledge of, or advice on, good practice and interpretation.” The Manifesto offers a “distillation of best practice in metrics-based research assessment,” in the form ten principles. Some of these principles include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment</em> …. assessors must not be tempted to cede decision-making to the numbers.</li>
<li><em>Measure performance against the research missions of the institution, group or researcher.</em> Programme goals should be stated at the start, and the indicators used to evaluate performance should relate clearly to those goals.</li>
<li><em>Allow those evaluated to verify data and analysis.</em> To ensure data quality, all researchers included in bibliometric studies should be able to check that their outputs have been correctly identified.</li>
<li><em>Account for variation by field in publication and citation practices.</em> Best practice is to select a suite of possible indicators and allow fields to choose among them.</li>
<li><em>Avoid misplaced concreteness and false precision.</em> Science and technology indicators are prone to conceptual ambiguity and uncertainty and require strong assumptions that are not universally accepted.</li>
<li><em>Recognize the systemic effects of assessment and indicators</em> …. a suite of indicators is always preferable — a single one will invite gaming and goal displacement (in which the measurement becomes the goal).</li>
</ol>
<p>These points imply important limitations and concerns about bibliometrics that will be echoed below: the need to base the choice of metrics on organizational goals rather than what’s convenient to measure; significant variation in data coverage and quality; and variations across fields. Point nine is also known as “Goodheart’s Law”: “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Tying resource allocations to publication counts encourages “salami slicing,” the rapid publication of many minimally-informative or low-quality (or even fraudulent) papers; while using citation counts incentivizes the formation of “citation cartels” <span class="citation" data-cites="KojakuDetectingAnomalousCitation2021">(Kojaku, Livan, and Masuda 2021)</span> or even manufacturing fake papers to inflate citation counts <span class="citation" data-cites="IbrahimGoogleScholarManipulatable2024">(Ibrahim et al. 2024)</span>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="outputs-outcomes-and-impacts" class="level1">
<h1>Outputs, outcomes, and impacts</h1>
<p>In program evaluation, there’s a useful distinction between outputs, outcomes, and impacts. <em>Outputs</em> are the direct products of the program’s activities, and the things the program has most control over. For research organizations, outcomes include things like scholarly publications, grey literature reports, social media posts by the organization or its members, grant applications submitted, and public-facing events. <em>Outcomes</em> are the short-term consequences that follow from those outputs: citations to publications, policymakers and advocates referencing reports, social and traditional media coverage, grant awards, attendance at public events. <em>Impacts</em> are the longer-term goals that the organization hopes to achieve by way of its outputs and outcomes. <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksImpactingCapabilitiesConceptual2018">Daniel J. Hicks, Stahmer, and Smith (2018)</span> further distinguish between inward-facing goals (“the value of research for the relevant scholarly community, in terms of the further production of new knowledge”) and outward-facing goals (“the value of research for other social practices …. [such as] broader social efforts to protect biodiversity and preserve natural or undeveloped spaces”).</p>
<p>These distinctions make it clear that bibliometrics — publication and citation counts, impact factors — are outputs and outcomes, rather than impacts. At best, these metrics are proxies for impacts, and indeed only proxies for inward-facing impacts. They provide at most limited insight into the scholarly impact of research, and none into social impact.</p>
<p>Despite being proxies, bibliometrics (incorrectly) appear to be useful for research assessment because impacts are often implicit, poorly defined, or difficult to measure, especially outward-facing social impacts. For example, in UC Merced’s 2021-2030 strategic plan, the first goal is to “Engage Our World and Region Through Discovery and the Advancement of Knowledge.” This is explained as including “interdisciplinary and transformational research that supports equity and prosperity globally and locally, with particular sensitivity for the San Joaquin Valley.” “Support[ing] equity and prosperity” is an outward-facing impact. It is appealing, but also so vague that the proposed measures don’t even try to operationalize it. Instead, the strategic plan lists various output measures (tenure rates, research spending) and a vague bibliometric item (“number of impactful papers,” with “[specific] measures to be developed”).</p>
<p>This is why the Leiden Manifesto states that “Programme goals should be stated at the start, and the indicators used to evaluate performance should relate clearly to those goals.” Without clear impacts it’s impossible to develop measures of progress or achievement with respect to those impacts.</p>
</section>
<section id="incommensurability-of-research-outputs-and-outcomes" class="level1">
<h1>Incommensurability of research outputs and outcomes</h1>
<p>In discussions at the SSHA department chairs and Executive Committee meetings, a repeated point has been that the outputs and outcomes are generally incommensurable. There is no meaningful, all-inclusive, unidimensional scale with which to compare a book written by a historian to a journal article written by a psychologist to a systematic review conducted by a team of biomedical researchers.</p>
<p>One aspect of incommensurability in this example is incommensurability by type of research output. Academic researchers produce numerous different kinds of outputs: monographs, anthologies, textbooks and other teaching materials; “original research” journal articles, reviews, theoretical papers, commentaries; white papers, policy reports; blog posts, opinion columns and letters, edutainment podcasts and videos, interactive websites, media interviews; conference presentations, keynotes and invited talks, flash talks, posters; artistic exhibitions and performances; workshops and conferences; public events.</p>
<p>These different kinds of outputs require not just different amounts of work, but different kinds of work and are anticipated to have qualitatively different kinds of outcomes and impacts. Even within a given field, an archive-based historical monograph is intended to do something very different from a short conference presentation or a public-facing website. It therefore does not make sense to ask how much “more” the monograph should “count” than the presentation or the website.</p>
<p>Research outcomes associated with a given type of output can also be incommensurable across fields. It is a commonplace in bibliometrics that the average citation rate differs across fields; for this reason, bibliometrics data providers such as Clarivate (Web of Science) and Elsevier (Scopus) provide “field-weighted” or “normalized” citation statistics.<sup>5</sup> One common explanation is differences in publication rates and citation practices. For example, in philosophy, a tenure-track assistant professor who publishes more than one paper per year (in “good journals”) would be considered highly productive; while a typical mid-sized biomedical lab might publish a dozen papers a year. Some fields, such as history, are expected to have lengthy and comprehensive bibliographies; while others, such as biomedicine, typically have short and selective bibliographies (except for systematic reviews, which are expected to be comprehensive, etc.). In line with this, <span class="citation" data-cites="RadicchiUniversalityCitationDistributions2008">Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano (2008)</span> argue that there is a “universal,” cross-field lognormal distribution of <em>relative</em> citations, that is, the number of citations received by a paper divided by the average number of citations received by all papers published in the same field and year. However, subsequent work on the “universal” citation distribution has not produced a consensus on the functional form it should take — lognormal, power-law, exponential, negative binomial, etc. — how it should be parameterized, and what underlying mechanisms might produce it <span class="citation" data-cites="GolosovskyUniversalityCitationDistributions2021">(Golosovsky 2021)</span>. Indeed, <span class="citation" data-cites="MarxCausesSubjectspecificCitation2015">Marx and Bornmann (2015)</span> argue that data quality plays a major role in cross-field differences, and in particular the poor coverage of the humanities by databases such as Web of Science.</p>
<p>For these reasons, “field-weighted” adjustments to citation counts have, at best, speculative and controversial theoretical support.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-reference-class-problem" class="level1">
<h1>The reference class problem</h1>
<p>Attempts to adjust bibliometrics for differences across fields also run into a significant theoretical problem, which <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeReferenceClassProblem2020">C. J. Lee (2020)</span> calls “<em>the reference class problem for credit valuation in science</em>: to which of the agent’s communities—which reference class—should credit valuations be indexed when determining the amount of credit the agent accrues …?” (1029, emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Academic fields are often thought of as clearly-bounded, discrete entities, reflecting the administrative division of universities into schools and departments. But reality is much messier than this: consider research areas such as quantum chemistry (operating across the boundaries between physics and chemistry), bioinformatics (molecular biology — itself biology and chemistry — and computer science), or behavioral economics (psychology and economics). Or indeed “interdisciplines” such as material science or cognitive science. Even within distinct fields, there can be radical differences in research questions, methods, and norms, as in anthropology (often divided into something like biological, cultural, archaeology, linguistics, and primatology), physics (experimental, theoretical, and cosmology), or philosophy (analytic, continental, and philosophy of science).</p>
<p>Because the boundaries within and between academic fields are so porous, a particular research project usually cannot be firmly located within a single research community, and an individual researcher or administrative unit will have a complex portfolio of projects spanning numerous different communities. For example, my Web of Science author profile<sup>6</sup> classifies me as working in History &amp; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; Public, Environmental &amp; Occupational Health; Environmental Sciences &amp; Ecology; and Science &amp; Technology - Other Topics. This leaves out several areas under which I could be categorized, such as gender studies, science communication, science policy, and statistics. And there are potentially important differences at lower levels of classification; for example, publishing and citation practices between historians and philosophers of science are quite different. In practice, there are perhaps a dozen different fields — and thus <em>no</em> field — against which the citations to my research can be normed.</p>
<p>Bibliometrics databases attempt to avoid this problem using multicategory classifications, which are often imprecise. For example, in Scopus’ All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) system<sup>7</sup>, <em>Nature Human Behavior</em> is classified as Psychology: Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Psychology: Social Psychology, and Neuroscience: Behavioral Neuroscience;<sup>8</sup> this journal also regularly publishes work in archaeology, cognitive science, and other fields across the social sciences. Across the 47,000 journals indexed by Scopus, the median journal has 2 ASJC codes, and more than 2,600 journals have 5 or more codes.</p>
</section>
<section id="tradeoffs-between-data-coverage-and-data-quality" class="level1">
<h1>Tradeoffs between data coverage and data quality</h1>
<p>A number of services provide bibliometric data. Web of Science and Scopus are commercial services; our campus subscribes to Web of Science. Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar are free. Web of Science and Scopus are not intended to cover every academic journal or book publisher, but instead the “highest impact journals” (<a href="https://webofscience.help.clarivate.com/Content/wos-core-collection/wos-core-collection.htm" class="uri">https://webofscience.help.clarivate.com/Content/wos-core-collection/wos-core-collection.htm</a>). Semantic Scholar and, especially, Google Scholar aim to be more comprehensive; users of Google Scholar will be familiar with search results including master’s theses, conference programs, preprints, grey literature reports, and other documents that don’t necessarily count as scholarly publications.</p>
<p>These differences in coverage partially explain why different services provide different values for standard bibliometrics such as publication count, citation count, and the h-index. Table&nbsp;1 compares results for my author profile across these four platforms and my personally maintained CV.</p>

<p>For me, Google Scholar lists nearly twice as many publications as Web of Science, and 2.9 times as many citations. Scopus reports a few more publications than Web of Science (14%), but 30% more citations. Semantic Scholar has almost as many publications as Google Scholar, but barely half as many citations. None of these include every publication listed on my CV.</p>
<p>The results for my author profile generalize: <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin-MartinGoogleScholarWeb2018">Martín-Martín et al. (2018)</span> found that Google Scholar reported nearly all citations found by Scopus and Web of Science, along with a large number of other citations, especially from “non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials” (1). In addition, a companion piece by the same authors, <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin-MartinCoverageHighlycitedDocuments2018">Martín-Martín, Orduna-Malea, and López-Cózar (2018)</span>, finds evidence that Web of Science and Scopus inclusion criteria are biased against social sciences and humanities: “a large fraction of highly-cited documents [according to Google Scholar] in the Social Sciences and Humanities (8.6–28.2%) are invisible to Web of Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and Health Sciences the proportion of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and Scopus is much lower.”</p>
<p>However, the broad coverage of Google Scholar comes with a critical tradeoff: poor data quality. My informal understanding is that Google has never employed professional librarians in the Scholar project, and relies almost entirely on machine learning to parse citations. While authors can edit the metadata on publications on their profile, there is no way to flag erroneous or questionable citations. <span class="citation" data-cites="SimontonGoogleScholarCitations">Simonton (n.d.)</span> chronicles severe metadata errors and erratic changes in citation counts on their Google Scholar profile. In a small study, <span class="citation" data-cites="SauvayreTypesErrorsHiding2022">Sauvayre (2022)</span> found that only two out of 281 purported citations to two source articles did not contain errors. <span class="citation" data-cites="IbrahimGoogleScholarManipulatable2024">Ibrahim et al. (2024)</span> show that citation counts on Google Scholar can easily be inflated by using an LLM to generate fake papers and posting them on preprint servers.</p>
<p>Semantic Scholar is not as widely-used as Google Scholar, and has not received the same kind of attention from scientometricians as a potential bibliometrics source. However, it also relies heavily on machine learning, may or may not employ librarians, and also has noticeable error rates. For example, while working on this document I realized that Semantic Scholar had conflated <em>Philosophy of Science</em> — the flagship journal in the field, published by CUP on behalf of my professional association, the US-based Philosophy of Science Association<sup>9</sup> — with <em>Philosophia Scientiæ</em> — a small journal, primarily in French, and published by the Université de Lorraine<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p>All together, to my knowledge there is no source of bibliometrics that can be considered to have both reliable coverage of the humanities and social sciences and reliable citation data.</p>

<h1>Gender and racial/ethnic bias</h1>
<p>There is a substantial literature examining gender and racial/ethnic bias in bibliometric and other measures of research productivity (e.g., grant application and funding rates). This literature consistently shows that women and racial/ethnic minorities are systematically disadvantaged from resource allocation through the publication process and on to citation rates, across fields. <span class="citation" data-cites="DaviesPromotingInclusiveMetrics2021">Davies et al. (2021)</span> provide a relatively recent review covering 43 different studies and reviews (pp 3-5). They argue that problems of underrepresentation by gender and race/ethnicity are “self-perpetuating due to reliance on citation metrics, which reflect deeply entrenched biases and exclusionary networks that disadvantage systemically marginalized groups, and these citation metric biases continue to rise globally” (4). Some specific notable findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“the citation gap between genders was found to be as large as 30% across 13 Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) disciplines”</li>
<li>“women receive more manuscript rejections … are less likely to be published in prestigious journals (which typically have high citation rates) …, and are less likely to be invited to write commentaries”</li>
<li>“racially and/or ethnically diverse scientific teams … experience more than 5% lower acceptance rates and fewer citations than less diverse author teams”</li>
<li>“Citational segregation—where authors prefer citing authors from the same racial/ethnic group(s)—has been demonstrated with white authors citing other white authors more frequently”</li>
<li>“gender and racial citation biases remain stable or have even worsened over the last half century” <span class="citation" data-cites="DaviesPromotingInclusiveMetrics2021">(Davies et al. 2021, 3–5)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="GintherRaceEthnicityNIH2011">Ginther et al. (2011)</span> found that Black and Asian applicants for NIH funding are significantly less likely to receive awards, even after controlling for factors such as educational background, prior awards, and publication records. They attributed some of this disparity to topic choice, with lower award rates for community and population-level research vs.&nbsp;“basic” or “fundamental” research. <span class="citation" data-cites="HofstraDiversityInnovationParadox2020">Hofstra et al. (2020)</span> find that “underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty” but “novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up at lower rates” than majorities. By combining text analysis with metadata and bibliometrics, <span class="citation" data-cites="HengelAreWomenHeld2022">Hengel (2022)</span> compares preprints to published versions of journal articles, arguing that women authors are held to higher standards than men and that this explains numerous gendered disparities in academic publishing: longer review times, lower acceptance rates, lower publication rates in the most prestigious journals, and lower submission rates. <span class="citation" data-cites="Masters-WaageUnderrepresentedMinorityFaculty2024">Masters-Waage et al.

Looking across fields, <span class="citation" data-cites="SugimotoEquityWomenScience2023">Sugimoto and Larivière (2023)</span> argues that “Disciplines with parity (or those dominated by women) tend to be lower cited and relegated to the bottom tiers of the academic hierarchy.”</p>
<p>An important proviso with virtually all of these studies is that they use automated demographic imputation, that is, imputing authors’ gender and race/ethnicity based on their names. <span class="citation" data-cites="LockhartNamebasedDemographicInference2023">Lockhart, King, and Munsch (2023)</span> shows that these methods are less accurate for both gender and racial/ethnicity minorities, which generally results in misclassifying members of minority groups as members of majorities. In general, measurement error on the independent variable produces <em>regression dilution</em>, in which estimated correlations/regression coefficients are biased towards 0. That is, all else being equal, automated demographic imputation would be expected to yield underestimations of the magnitude of gender and racial/ethnic bias.</p>

<section id="quantification-as-depoliticization" class="level1">
<h1>Quantification as depoliticization</h1>
<p>Thus far, I have offered “technical” critiques of bibliometrics, showing limitations in their fit for purpose as measures of research quality. But it is important to recognize that, in the context of decisions such as how to allocate faculty lines, bibliometrics also have a broader function, as what we might call a <em>depoliticization strategy</em>.</p>
<p>STS scholars argue that quantification or <em>scientization</em> — replacing explicitly political decisionmaking processes with expert or “data-driven” processes — is a key legitimizing strategy used by modern states and other political and social authorities <span class="citation" data-cites="JasanoffFifthBranchScience1990 PorterTrustNumbersPursuit1995 SarewitzScienceEnvironmentalPolicy2000">(Jasanoff 1990; Porter 1995; Sarewitz 2000)</span>. This strategy was on display in 2020, when political leaders presented themselves as “following the science.” Even Covid skeptics made their arguments in terms of quantified evidence and data visualizations <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">(C. Lee et al. 2021)</span>. On an individual level, many students in my Critical Thinking course come in thinking that using numbers is enough to make an argument valid — without regard to how those numbers were produced and whether they have anything to do with the conclusion the argument is attempting to support.</p>
<p>Broadly, in our society quantified evidence is treated as extra-political — existing outside or beyond (political) controversy — and therefore super-political — taking precedence over and even shutting down (political) controversy. Quantification is thereby appealing when political controversies seem to be heated and intractable, appearing to give us (that is, whoever has the power to impose a particular system of quantification) a way to end debate and resolve the issue, moving it outside or beyond politics. Thus, “depoliticization.”</p>
<p>Allocating extremely scarce resources such as faculty lines is already a touchy issue. Doing so under conditions of existential uncertainty for American higher ed, impending demographic decline, and pre-existing structural deficits only makes the controversy more fraught. In this context, bibliometrics appear to provide an “objective,” depoliticizing solution.</p>
<p>However, the “technical” critiques I have offered show that the promise of using bibliometrics to depoliticize decisions about faculty lines is a mirage. Any attempt to operationalize bibliometrics for decisionmaking requires prior decisions, about how to compare incommensurable research outputs, how to assign departmental research portfolios to fields and adjust for differences between fields, which source(s) of bibliometrics data to use and how to manage the corresponding tradeoffs between coverage and data quality, and how to mitigate rather than exacerbate the influence of deep structural biases. Rather than depoliticizing, bibliometrics would simply become a new arena for political controversy <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksScientificControversiesProxy2017 HicksSafetyAutonomousVehicles2018">(Daniel J. Hicks 2017; D. J. Hicks 2018)</span>, as different interests across campus push for different ways of resolving these prior decisions that happen to benefit their particular group.</p>
</section>
<section id="recommendations-1" class="level1">
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Bibliometrics are neither fit for purpose as measures of research quality nor strategically useful for cooling heated controversies. As an alternative, I would recommend adopting a process with the following features, based on general best practices in research assessment/evaluation and points from the Leiden Manifesto in particular:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start by articulating aims</p>
<p>Faculty hires can serve many different kinds of goals, both inward-facing (scholarly) and outward-facing (social or community): growing (or maintaining) enrollments, developing a unit’s existing research strengths, broadening a unit’s coverage, fostering interdisciplinary research, attracting external funding, addressing a significant social issue, supporting a certain local community, and so on. The campus should develop specific versions of these or other goals, as the primary basis on which hiring decisions will be made.</p></li>
<li><p>Approach hiring requests as program impact plans</p>
<p>Program impact plans — also known as theories of change and logic models — describe how an organization believes that a certain course of action does (or will) lead to certain outputs, and thereby downstream outcomes and impacts that ultimately promote the organization’s aims. For example, given an aim of strengthening ties between engineers and social scientists in robotics research, a NSF funding program might devote 20% of its funds to a solicitation that requires two PIs, one from each area. The program impact plan would identify, as an output, more funding to interdisciplinary teams; as outcomes, funded researchers publishing in a wider variety of journals than they would have otherwise and an increased presence of social scientists at (engineering-oriented) robotics conferences; and as an impact, incorporation of social science research findings into engineering research.</p>
<p>Departments wishing to hire faculty could take a similar approach, preparing short statements (say, capped at 1,000 words) that explain, for example, how a new hire in a particular area would enable them to add an attractive emphasis track to their major and regularly offer a popular elective course for another major (outputs); how this would make the campus more competitive for potential students in both majors (outcomes); and thereby promote enrollment growth (or counteract trends in declining enrollment; impacts).</p>
<p>These program impact plans should follow the warning of the Leiden Manifesto, and avoid misplaced concreteness and false precision: quantitative enrollment estimates are much more uncertain than they might appear to be. It is also important to recognize the possibility of bias in qualitative assessment; for example, STEM majors as such are not necessarily more popular with students than humanities majors. Nonetheless, both faculty and campus administrators can assess whether a given hiring proposal might plausibly lead to the anticipated outputs, outcomes, and impacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Faculty provide peer review</p>
<p>While it is impossible to completely depoliticize high-stakes resource allocations decisions, it is worth considering peer review — especially for research funding — as a familiar model of political decisionmaking that does not often erupt into intractable, heated controversy. I have seen firsthand how SSHA’s Curriculum Committee throughly but constructively scrutinizes proposals for new majors. UC Merced might take a similar approach to hiring faculty: departments could prepare hiring proposals — in the form of program impact plans — which would be reviewed by school Executive Committees, and then by CAPRA and/or other Senate committees. Reviewing committees could provide both qualitative evaluations and rubric-based assessments of each proposal, along the lines of NSF and NIH.</p>
<p>While far from perfect, distributing power over faculty hires and incorporating accountability/transparency would be preferable to the current system, which often relies heavily on patronage relations among individual faculty, deans, and the provost.</p></li>

  <title>Is this how you think DEI works at colleges and universities? (rejected from r/AskTrumpSupporters)</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bringing this question over from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathanielcgreen.bsky.social/post/3liz5pbiges2f">Bluesky</a>, where I first saw it reposted. It’s based on a tweet (post?) on X by an account I don’t know.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing the tweet, “DEI is a novel bureaucracy that had been created within the college system, which represented neither the faculty nor the students, and it was starting to act like many faculty members’ direct supervisor and telling them how to teach.”</p>
<p>My question: Does this explanation fit with how you think DEI works at colleges and universities?</p>
<p>(Just to be clear, in my experience this is not at all how it works. I’m a college professor, a social scientist, and I’ve taught at six different schools over the past 20+ years. I’ve never had anyone audit my syllabus or tell me what I should or shouldn’t teach. A few years ago the faculty in my department did an exercise in diversifying the authors on our syllabi. This was entirely voluntary; we decided as a department to do it, some of us made no changes, and some of us made big changes. We’re interested in hiring someone who specializes in our field’s version of critical race theory, because our student body is majority Hispanic and they’re really interested in taking those classes. If we or the students had different priorities, we’d be trying to hire in another area instead. The DEI office at my current school mostly puts on events and organizes mentoring programs.)</p>

  <title>Weaponized metascience</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2025-01-14-weaponized-metascience.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A couple days ago, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database">released</a> a spreadsheet of about 3.5k “woke DEI grants” made by NSF. This spreadsheet was the basis for <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/4BD2D522-2092-4246-91A5-58EEF99750BC">a report</a> released last October by the minority of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee (of which Cruz was the minority chair). Congressional Republicans have a long history of complaining that NSF funds “wasteful” or “silly” projects, and this report and spreadsheet continue that tradition, using the anti-DEI framing that happens to be popular today.</p>
<p>As a computational social scientist and philosopher of science, one thing that struck me about the report was a “methods section,” a pair of appendices that narrated the text mining methods used by congressional staff to assemble the list of awards and apply labels such as “social justice.” Staff used “N-gram analysis” to find “the most-often-used terms and phrases” across about 30,000 NSF award abstracts, then “parsed those terms for DEI keywords and phrases,” “using over 800,000 variations and combinations.” The second appendix is a series of term lists — one for each of the five labels — with a total of about 750 words or short phrases. The authors of the report used multiple rounds of filtering, “a categorization ‘qualifier’ tagging formula in Excel,” and three rounds of manual review, to arrive at the final list of about 3.5k awards and the five labels.</p>
<p>At this level of description, the methods used to assemble this report are similar to methods my research group uses in our own text mining projects. For example, in a paper currently under review, using the fulltext of tens of thousands of journal articles we trace the presence of race science across mainstream and fringe scientific journals over the second half of the twentieth century. Such work is often grouped under the interdisciplinary heading of “metascience,” utilizing scientific methods to better understand scientific research processes and communities.</p>
<p>In this sense, Senator Cruz is engaged in <strong>weaponized metascience</strong>: using metascience in an attempt to undermine the political and cultural standing of scientific research.</p>
<p>Like congressional complaints about NSF, weaponized metascience is not new. During the first Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed (and briefly adopted) a rule, originally called “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science,” that appealed to concerns about a widespread replication crisis and the open science movement in an effort to undermine the use of public health research at the agency. Numerous scientists and advocacy organizations criticized the rule as “anti-science,” without noting that it appealed to widespread sentiments within the scientific community itself <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksWhenVirtuesAre2022 HicksOpenScienceReplication2023">(D. J. Hicks 2022b, 2023)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>It should not be surprising that the quality of weaponized metascience is often low by the standards of academic research. In text mining, one way to avoid “false positives” is to filter out documents that only match a single keyword. This filter is idempotent, meaning that it has no effect after being run once: all of the single-match documents are removed on the first pass. Nonetheless, the “methods section” of the Cruz report says that this filter was applied twice, at two different stages of review. The first pass removed 3,118 awards; and, somehow, the second removed 5,715. At best, this is a serious misreporting error, perhaps if the second pass involved a much larger keyword list; at worst it indicates a severe error in the analysis scripts.</p>
<p>The report also makes claims that these methods, and the resulting database, cannot possibly support. For example, the report claims that “Instead of identifying the best or most talented scientists, NSF funded researchers who prioritized filling out research teams and programs based on ethnicity, cultural background, or political perspectives.”</p>
<p>Most of the researchers funded by NSF grants — students, postdoctoral researchers, professional research staff — are hired by the universities that receive the awards, not NSF. Some personnel are named in the initial grant application, but otherwise universities don’t notify NSF who they hire using NSF-awarded funds, much less report them for release in a public database. The particular data portal used by Cruz’ staff does not even contain the names of the primary investigator for each award (though these names are available through NSF’s award search portal). And, of course, even if Cruz’ staff did somehow know the <em>names</em> of the members of the research teams, they still wouldn’t know their qualifications, ethnicity, cultural backgrounds, or political perspectives, much less what role these factors played in the hiring decisions.</p>
<p>Similarly, a distinguished statistician — a fellow of both the American Statistical Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of EPA’s Science Advisory Board during the first Trump administration — published numerous papers using a fundamentally flawed statistical methodology <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksValuePlotDoes2022">(D. J. Hicks 2022a)</span>. Many of these papers claimed to show that research misconduct was widespread in air pollution epidemiology. At least some were funded by the American Petroleum Institute <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksYoungsPValuePlot2022">(D. Hicks 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>As a final example, recently the Trump administration attempted to unilaterally impose a cap of 15% on indirect costs for NIH-funded awards. Reporters at Wired <span class="citation" data-cites="ReynoldsNIHFundingCuts">(Reynolds n.d.)</span> traced this policy to a <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/indirect-costs-how-taxpayers-subsidize-university-nonsense">report</a> by two affiliates of the Heritage Foundation, which alleged that indirect costs were used to “subsidize the agenda of the political left through funding its research agendas and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) staff on university campuses.” The primary evidence for this claim was a collection of simple univariable regressions of the number of “DEI staff” against indirect costs for 82 universities. The authors of the report made no effort whatsoever to adjust for potential confounders in this regression — despite the lead author being a former Distinguished Professor and education researcher at the University of Arkansas.</p>
<hr>
<p>But the low quality of weaponized metascience is beside the point. The purpose of weaponized metascience is to <em>appear</em> scientific, to adopt the trappings of science in order to discredit science. Over the past 150 years or so, our society has become deeply “scientistic,” holding up science (or things that look like science) as the best and most reliable source of knowledge. Science and its defenders need to understand that, by and large, the contemporary far right and its allies are not interested in challenging this scientism. Project 2025 doesn’t say anything about replacing evolution with intelligent design in schools, for example. Instead the goal is to turn science into a tool of their political and cultural project, dominated by conservative, nationalistic, straight white men. To Make Science Great Again.</p>

  <title>Weaponizing Value Freedom in Defense of Race Science</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2024-12-22-weaponizing-value-freedom.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The aim of this blog post is to illustrate the ways value freedom is weaponized in defense of race science by <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span>.</p>
<p>Following the definitions in <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksRaceScienceMainstream2024">Hicks and Lobato (2024)</span>, I understand <em>scientific racism</em> as the social practice of purporting to justify racial inequality and colonialism by appealing to the epistemic authority of science. And <em>race science</em> refers to scientific and/or pseudoscientific research, including research products (journal articles, etc.), that can be utilized for scientific racism.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> is one of a pair of articles replying to <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> offer a critique of <em>racial hereditarianism research</em> (RHR), which they characterize as research products that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>claim that folk racial classifications are biologically meaningful categories and that racial differences in intelligence test scores, educational attainment, income, and crime partly or even primarily originate from genetic differences between races. (497)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand RHR as a specific line of race science.</p>
<p>A real paper would give more context to the exchange of papers between these two groups of authors here.</p>
<p>I argue that <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> weaponize value-freedom in a number of ways (to be discussed below), claiming that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> violate value-freedom and therefore their critique of RHR/race science can be dismissed.</p>
<p>I first make some preliminary remarks on value-freedom, as I use the term here. Next I assess <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span>’s appeal to Robert Merton’s norms of science. I discuss the importance of implicature in the relationship between race science and scientific racism, and conclude by reflecting on the way a “value freedom tu quoque” are used to deflect charges of violating value freedom.</p>
<section id="value-freedom" class="level1">
<h1>Value freedom</h1>
<p>In this post, I use the term “value freedom,” rather than the more common term in philosophy of science, “the value-free ideal” or VFI. Philosophers’ understanding of VFI has a narrow scope: it prohibits only the influence of non-epistemic values in a particular “core,” “epistemic” “stage” of scientific inquiry. <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> do not appear to use such a narrowly-scoped idea; instead they appeal to a conceptual separation between research and its application and the political motivations of their interlocutors independent of “stages” of inquiry.</p>
<p>These ideas — VFI, the research/application distinction, and motivations in general — are related, but logically distinct. <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> do not appeal to VFI, in the strict sense; but they do appeal to a cluster of related ideas, that can be usefully grouped under the general heading of “value freedom.”</p>
<p>The research/application distinction can be seen in the way <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> respond to the argument that the Buffalo mass shooter’s cited race science research in his manifesto. They argue that this critique is “somewhat like demanding that chemistry be outlawed and its practitioners smeared as having blood on their hands, just because some terrorists use chemistry to make poisons or explosives that kill people” (2).<sup>1</sup> Later, they provide quotations from earlier papers that recognize “that more must be done to avoid politicized misuse of socially salient research” because “a tendency for some of our ideas to be misappropriated by highly politically motivated individuals online,” and so “we have failed to make sufficient efforts to clearly disconnect our work from political ideologies” (4). In the immediately following paragraph, they complain that “despite this apparent candor and restraint, such researchers somehow still are cast as shouldering responsibility whenever some disturbed individual misappropriates some of their ideas” (4).</p>
<p>In these passages, <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> separate race science research from its (harmful) downstream application. The chemical weapons analogy and the final quotation from page 4 claim that race scientists are not responsible for these applications. The “failed to make sufficient efforts” quotation accepts responsibility — but apparently only for insufficient value freedom <em>within</em> their research. Their responsibility does not extend to the distinct act of “misappropriat[ion].”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Near the end of §3, <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> claim that “BJ&amp;W’s real motivation is their political ideology … rather than any balanced appraisal of the costs and benefits to society of” race science (3). From here, they assert that race science is opposed because it “contradict[s] the sacred values of political groups,” evoke the Lysenko affair, claim that “the radical left” does not distinguish between “RHR, genetics, evolutionary psychology, eugenics, systemic racism and sexism, IQ testing, and, indeed, Mertonian norms of science themselves,” and conclude that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span>’s policy proposals would lead down a slippery slope to broad censorship (4-5). This line of thought alleges that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> are violating value freedom, but not (merely) in the “core” stage of gathering evidence and evaluating hypotheses, i.e., within the scope of VFI. The violation appears to be either holding left-wing values itself or — to be charitable to <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> — perhaps using left-wing values as premises in policy arguments.</p>
</section>
<section id="mertonian-and-anti-mertonian-norms" class="level1">
<h1>Mertonian and Anti-Mertonian Norms</h1>
<p>The title and §1 claim that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> are proposing to replace the “Mertonian norms” — the “ethos of science” described by sociologist Robert Merton — with a set of “anti-Mertonian norms.”</p>
<p>If this were a real paper, I would summarize the “anti-Mertonian norms” here. I would also note that <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> misquote <span class="citation" data-cites="MertonNoteScienceDemocracy1942">Robert K. Merton (1942)</span> (121), renaming the norm of communism as “communality.”</p>
<p>The appeal to Merton to defend value freedom is ironic, because Merton presented the “ethos of science” as an explicitly ideological argument against fascism — especially in Germany, and especially race science — and for liberal democracy <span class="citation" data-cites="MertonScienceSocialOrder1938 MertonNoteScienceDemocracy1942">(Robert K. Merton 1938; Robert K. Merton 1942)</span>.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> cite <span class="citation" data-cites="MitroffNormsCounterNormsSelect1974">Mitroff (1974)</span> as a reference for the concept of “anti-norms” (Mitroff’s term is “counter-norms”) but miss the significance of not only Mitroff’s paper but also Merton’s later work on norms of science as summarized on the first few pages of Mitroff’s paper. In Merton’s later work, in any complex social practice such as science, the “dominant [norms] alone would not be flexible enough to provide for the endlessly varying contingencies of social relations” <span class="citation" data-cites="MitroffNormsCounterNormsSelect1974">(Merton and Barber as quoted by Mitroff 1974, 579)</span>. Contrasting, “subsidiary counter-norms” develop to enable this necessary flexibility. For example, sociologists and philosophers — including Merton himself — have long recognized that, along with and in contrast to communism, scientists are often motivated by self-interest, chasing credit and prestige, under the “priority rule” that the first to publish a significant new discovery receives all the credit for it <span class="citation" data-cites="StrevensRolePriorityRule2003">(Strevens and Journal of Philosophy, Inc. 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>In this light, even as characterized by <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span>, the “counter-norms” proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> can be seen as giving useful flexibility to an excessively narrow reading of Merton’s norms:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>secrecy</em> recognizes that some scientific evidence or even findings are too sensitive and potentially dangerous to publish (locations of endangered species that might be targeted by poachers; Indigenous sacred sites that also carry Traditional Ecological Knowledge; instructions for producing weapons of mass destruction)</li>
<li><em>particularism</em> recognizes that the work of scientific bad actors should receive, at a minimum, heightened scrutiny (individuals who have committed serious research misconduct; cranks who refuse to respect the uptake norm requiring response to criticism)</li>
<li><em>interested</em> recognizes that, when scientific research carries elevated risk for harmful downstream social consequences, it is appropriate to require a more demanding standard of evidence <span class="citation" data-cites="KitcherArgumentFreeInquiry1997 HavstadSensationalScienceArchaic2021 MeyerWrestlingSocialBehavioral2023">(Kitcher 1997; Havstad 2021; Meyer et al. 2023)</span></li>
<li><em>organized dogmatism</em> designates certain questions as so thoroughly studied and rival research programs so degenerate <span class="citation" data-cites="LakatosFalsificationMethodologyScientific2004">(Lakatos 2004)</span> that there is no expected value in continuing to regard those questions as open and those rival research programs as pursuitworthy (anthropogenic climate change)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, taking the Mertonian norms as the exclusive norms for a scientific community would be corrosive, as it would leave the community vulnerable to cranks, fraudsters, and merchants of doubt.</p>
<p>Both Merton’s norms and the “<span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> counter-norms” require the exercise of judgment. When exactly does a norm apply, what exactly does it require or prohibit, and how should it be balanced against other, conflicting norms? Scientists are likely to disagree about such questions, and scientific communities must necessarily engage in internal politics to establish the bounds of reasonable disagreement over the answers. Both <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> should be read as salvos in a political conflict unfolding within contemporary psychology.</p>
</section>
<section id="implicature-and-the-denial-of-responsibility" class="level1">
<h1>Implicature and the Denial of Responsibility</h1>
<p>The concept of implicature was developed by the philosopher of language Paul Grice to characterize the way in which language often communicates meaning beyond its explicit content and strict deductive entailments. An example comes from §1 of <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> itself.

(2025)</span> say explicitly that the “anti-Mertonian norms” they attribute to <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> will be corrosive, destructive, or otherwise bad. Instead, they argue that the Mertonian norms “embody centuries of research experience, and reflect a long-established consensus among academic scientists about ways of doing research that tend to promote the highest rate of scientific progress” (2). Taken literally, this argument does not entail anything whatsoever about the “anti-Mertonian norms”; strictly speaking, it is logically irrelevant to the latter norms. But the implicature is that the latter norms will tradition, reject consensus, and will frustrate rather than promote scientific progress.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Implicature is crucial to the phenomenon of racial dogwhistles. Phrases like “wolf pack” and “welfare mothers” do not explicitly refer or deductively entail anything about African Americans, and thus allow their users to deflect charges of racism. But in the US political context these phrases readily communicate pernicious stereotypes that young Black men are dangerous, subhuman criminals and Black women are lazy abusers of the social safety net.</p>
<p>Implicature is context-dependent. These particular racial dogwhistles are likely to be less effective outside the US.</p>
<p>Implicature can also be independent of the speaker’s communicative intent. Someone can invoke racial stereotypes without realizing they are doing so, and indeed even when they would explicitly reject these stereotypes.</p>
<p>I propose that implicature is often what connects race science to scientific racism. A piece of research can be taken up and used to purportedly justify racial inequality <em>not</em> because of the researcher’s own racist intentions (indeed, they might explicitly denounce such intentions) or its explicit conclusions (indeed, the research might not say anything explicit about race at all) but because <em>in a certain context</em> it is amenable to being interpreted as providing such a justification. <span class="citation" data-cites="WillsAreClustersRaces2017">(For analysis of an example from human genomics, see Wills 2017.)</span></p>
<p>The idea of “misuse” or “misappropriation” is crucial to the way <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> deny responsibility for scientific racist use of race science research, as in their responses to the Buffalo shooter manifesto. “Misuse” appears six times in the five-page paper, and “misappropriation” three times (all on page 4).</p>
<p>But implicature significantly complicates the idea of “misuse” or “misappropriation” of scientific research. Because implicature extends beyond the speaker’s intention, a simplistic conception of misuse — in terms of how a researcher intended their research to be used — is inapt, and provides the same rhetorical cover that dogwhistles provide race-baiting politicians and “just asking questions” provides conspiracy theorists.<sup>5</sup> A more robust approach might come from the law of torts, and the notion of “reasonable foresight,” that is, whether a “reasonable scientist” could have foreseen this application of their research and its consequences <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasSciencePolicyValuefree2009">(Douglas 2009 ch.&nbsp;4)</span>. As with norms and counter-norms, the bounds of what counts as a “reasonable scientist” and what they can foresee are necessarily a political issue.</p>
<p>Again, implicatures are context-dependent, and <span class="citation" data-cites="KitcherArgumentFreeInquiry1997">Kitcher (1997)</span> identified some key features of contemporary Anglophone societies that support scientific racist implicatures. Briefly, these features are asymmetries in the uptake of racial differences research: research that supports scientific racism will be taken up and the degree of support exaggerated, while research that challenges scientific racism will be rejected (not taken up) and its degree of challenge downplayed.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span> claim that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span>’s proposals would “backfire” with three kinds of “unintended consequences” (3): blocking research that uncovers evidence supporting “racial environmentalist hypotheses”; blocking research that challenges views that circulate among white nationalists,<sup>6</sup> and third, these proposals “would also apply very broadly to all of ‘mainstream human genetics’” (4).</p>
<p>The first two unintended consequences founder on Kitcher’s asymmetries. Insofar as they obtain, both kinds of research would tend to be rejected and their degree of challenge to scientific racism downplayed.</p>
<p>In addition, both kinds of research carry scientific racist implicatures, namely, that it is an open and scientifically legitimate possibility that there is a “natural” racial hierarchy based on differences in “innate” ability. Even research that is intended to undermine racial hierarchy, is expected to produce evidence challenging scientific racism, and actually does produce such evidence, assumes that the question of “natural” racial hierarchy remains unanswered.</p>

<section id="weaponizing-value-freedom-to-deflect-charges-of-violating-value-freedom" class="level1">
<h1>Weaponizing value freedom to deflect charges of violating value freedom</h1>
<p>A core element of <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span>’s critique is that race science promotes the pernicious and morally noxious worldview of scientific racism. This critique does not need to assume value freedom: one can regard scientific racism as pernicious and morally noxious without assume that science should be, in some general sense or another, value free. But it can be read through the lens of value freedom: race science promotes non-neutral values and therefore race science should be avoided. <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> occasionally use something like this framing: “we dispute claims of ‘value neutrality’ for this research” (498); “These conclusions are not value-free or ideologically neutral” (499).</p>
<p>A major thread of <span class="citation" data-cites="WoodleyOfMenieAntiMertonianNormsUndermine2025">Woodley Of Menie et al. (2025)</span>’s reply is a tu quoque that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> have violated value freedom, in the ways discussed above. This argument strategy has a long history in responses to critiques that science promotes racism, sexism, or other forms of injustice. In the “science wars” of the 1990s it was used against feminist critiques of sexist science <span class="citation" data-cites="LloydObjectivityDoubleStandard1995 LloydScienceAntiScienceObjectivity1997">(E. A. Lloyd 1995; E. Lloyd 1997)</span>. It is deployed today in rants that claim DEI initiatives undermine “merit in science.”</p>
<p>Such arguments are often logically irrelevant, in two ways. First, they do not provide any reason or evidence to think that race scientists have not violated value freedom. Even if we accept that <span class="citation" data-cites="BirdConfrontingScientificRacism2024">Bird, Jackson Jr., and Winston (2024)</span> violated value freedom, this does not give us a reason to think that, say, Richard Lynn did not violate value freedom. Second, these arguments are often made against interlocutors who do not accept value freedom, do think that science should necessarily be value free. (The difference between rejecting race science on the basis of value freedom and rejecting it on the basis of antiracist values.) So the tu quoque does not show that the interlocutor is being inconsistent or hypocritical, endorsing a principle while also violating it.</p>
<p>These arguments often have other problems, like the ones I’ve identified here: based on a superficial misreading of source material, applied inconsistently or without thinking through the logical implications of a position, and so on.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these arguments can be rhetorically effective, insofar as they shift the focus of debate from race science to its critics, DARVO-style, and insofar as the audience does accept value freedom and consequently regards the critics as discredited and not worth engaging. And many scientists and members of the general public do think that science should be value free.</p>
<p>In this sense, these arguments weaponize value freedom to deflect charges of violations of value freedom.</p>

  <title>How I’m handling LLMs (Fall 2024 edition)</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2024-12-17-LLMs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>With the Fall term wrapping up in Northern American higher ed, a lot of my fellow humanities professors are reflecting on the way they feel forced to change their writing assignments to respond to LLMs. A lot of people are moving to only doing in-class writing — and bemoaning the loss of longer, more involved paper assignments.</p>
<p>This semester I taught an upper-division undergrad course that satisfied a “Writing in the Discipline” GE requirement, for which students are supposed to write roughly 5,000 words. So, to pass the class with a B,<sup>1</sup> this semester my students needed to write four short papers (highly structured, 4 paragraphs, 300-400 words each), revise two of those short papers based on my feedback, revise and expand one into a mid-length paper (about 1k words), and then revise and expand it again into a “full paper” (about 2k words). To get an A, in addition they needed to either write a second mid-length paper or submit a draft of the “full paper” about a month early for an extra round of feedback and revision.</p>
<p>None of this writing was done in class. Out of 24 students, I had one who used an LLM in a way that violated the class LLM policy, and that was on a single assignment. Perhaps there are a few more that I’ve missed; but I’m not seeing “they’re all cheating!” like some of my colleagues are reporting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to document what I did. Maybe I got lucky? Maybe it won’t work in the future? Or maybe it’ll work for you too?</p>
<p>First, I had the students read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13afWz7Nw5zRL8abad4aZJM9vCCluaPus/view">a pair of essays on the value of first drafts</a>.<sup>2</sup> The first is Anne Lamont’s “Messy First Drafts,” from the ’90s; the second is a recent blog post that references the first and argues against using an LLM to write the first draft of a paper. (In the future, I plan to include <a href="https://prodev.illinoisstate.edu/ai/usage/">this taxonomy of LLM usage</a> as part of the assigned reading.)</p>
<p>Second, I <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GbOOTYEB0G4W5dkCnbkFOOUPMH-BEopfc22OZKpX8Ng/edit?tab=t.0">anonymously collected students’ experience and thoughts on LLMs</a>. I think anonymity was important for candor here. In class, we discussed the two essays, and I had them read and react to another student’s anonymous paragraph.</p>
<p>Third, I had the students determine our class LLM policy. The taxonomy I linked up above was really helpful for structuring this discussion and the resulting policy. The class deliberated in small groups, then collectively, and voted to accept the policy for each potential use. There was some good debate over “brainstorming” and the exact wording for “co-create and revise.” The vote was generally unanimous; for one or two levels a couple-three were opposed. This was the result, as added to the syllabus:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In October, the class discussed the use of LLMs (large language models, such as ChatGPT) on course assignments. Using this taxonomy, we deliberated and voted to adopt the following policy. Violations are a form of academic misconduct.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p><strong>No use:</strong> Always permitted, except when a particular assignment explicitly requires use of a LLM. Except for those assignments, you’re never required to use a LLM in any way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organizational:</strong> Permitted, but you’re encouraged to check the LLM output for accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Permitted only for developing the “big picture” of an assignment. You’re also encouraged to check the LLM output for accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Permitted, but you must explicitly state that you used the LLM and note how.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Co-create and revise:</strong> Depends on how the LLM is used to co-create and revise your work. For developing an outline, you may use the section headings and overall structure, but not further details that the LLM provides, such as a suggested thesis or argument. For drafting the paper, LLM use is prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unrestricted, attributed:</strong> Generally prohibited. Some particular assignments may explicitly permit or require using a LLM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unrestricted, unattributed:</strong> Always prohibited.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I would not have permitted “brainstorming” or the outline-development use under “co-create and revise.” But I suspect respecting their autonomy — literally! — was important for the (apparent) high rate of compliance.</p>
<p>Fourth, each writing assignment had to include a wrapper, which among other things asked what resources were used on the paper, how they were used, and which was most useful. The resources included things like meeting 1-1 with me, the Writing Center, and Grammarly, along with an LLM. Grammarly is extremely popular; most of my students reported using it. Only a few students reported using an LLM, and most often it was to help summarize a reading or other source (which falls under “organizational” use).</p>
<p>The only violation I identified and acted upon happened a couple of weeks after the class formulated their policy. The fifth thing I did was handle this as a learning opportunity rather than the first stage of a disciplinary process. I asked the student to meet with me, and started by saying that I didn’t want this to become a disciplinary process. We talked about how they had used the LLM on the paper, and the stylistic telltales that made me suspect the policy had been violated. In particular, I explained how ChatGPT is very good at using sophisticated vocabulary and complex grammar to make very generic, shallow points. It’s not very insightful, and can’t put together a very compelling argument by philosophical standards. These points seemed to be well-taken. We also reviewed the LLM policy, and I reminded them of some elements of the class discussion behind it. After about 15 minutes of discussion, the student agreed that they had violated the policy, and accepted my offer to rewrite the paper from scratch. They did so, I gave them full credit, and we were able to move on.</p>
<p>More generally, I think it’s important to avoid an antagonistic relationship with my students. In my view, academic misconduct has two primary causes: the intense demands on students’ time and mental health; and a purely credentialist attitude towards education, that is, an attitude that the sole value of education is a formal credential (and not even instrumentally useful skills). Increased surveillance and threats likely exacerbate the demands on students and further alienate them from their coursework. This means they’re more rather than less likely to engage in misconduct. On the other hand, accommodating students’ needs and getting them to reflect on skills like writing a first draft likely reduce the chances of misconduct.</p>
<p>This approach requires being comfortable with “false negatives,” students who engage in misconduct — say, having ChatGPT write their papers from scratch — but aren’t caught and disciplined. Here I like the adage “You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them drink.” Students who engage in misconduct in my classes are likely either struggling with major personal crises or have become irremediably cynical about the value of education. In both cases, they’re beyond my ability to help. That’s a sad and frustrating realization, but it’s one that allows me to devote my time and attention to teaching rather than prosecuting misconduct cases.</p>

  <title>The parable of fire ecology</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2024-11-08-fire-ecology.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>On Wednesday, after the election, I experienced a minor depressive episode: anhedonia, insomnia, loss of appetite, GI weirdness. I cleared the few remaining things on my schedule and went up to Ahwahne — Yosemite Valley — for the day. In my Environmental Philosophy and Politics class, we’ve been talking a fair amount about prescribed burning, and even took a field trip to Yosemite NP a few weeks ago to examine the fire landscape of the park in person. This inspired the following parable.</em></p>
<p>We Californians live in a landscape that is prone to catastrophic megafires. This was not intentional. No one set about trying to make our forest ecosystems as fire-prone as possible. Indeed, the intention was the opposite: to eliminate fire, in order to maximize the exploitation of the land for people and profit (with a subtle but very real emphasis on the second part). But it turns out that a landscape that’s very suitable for intense exploitation is also very suitable for intense conflagration.</p>
<p>The good news is that this problem is fixable. We can restore the landscape, cleaning up the accumulated debris and ladder fuels that turn ordinary sparks and healthy low-intensity fires into mass destruction events. We don’t necessarily understand all of the things that we need to do. But some initial steps are pretty clear.</p>
<p>That’s the good news. There’s also bad news. The work is hard, extensive, and slow. It took decades to create our current landscape, and it will be decades to restore it. We will see progress over the course of our lifetimes — but probably only fairly modest progress. The work that needs to be done is also controversial, with opposition from both those who benefit from an exploitable landscape and those who, operating under dated ideologies of “let nature run its course,” see the work that needs to be done as immoral.</p>
<p>What can we do? Pick a patch and get to work. Don’t forget about the forest, but focusing your attention on one stand of trees will let you make a visible difference on a human timescale. And work in solidarity. The work needs different skills, capacities, and resources. No one person can do everything that needs to be done, and we all can contribute in our own way.</p>
<p>Above all, remember that a better world is possible, and we are the ones we’ve been waiting for.</p>

  <title>Writing a draft is sketching, not vomiting</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2024-10-04-writing-sketching.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Yesterday our Environmental Philosophy class had an interesting discussion about writing first drafts. Several of the students used a vomiting metaphor to describe this stage of the writing process, as in, vomiting all your ideas out onto the page. The essays we read to start this conversation didn’t use this metaphor, but multiple small groups independently suggested it.</p>
<p>I think the vomiting metaphor is meant to express the sense that writing a first draft is messy and thorough. A first draft doesn’t need to tightly follow an assignment structure or other formal requirements; it’ll always have a mix of good ideas and bad ones; and it’s okay if the grammar and word choice are awkward or idiosyncratic. You also want all of your potential ideas out on paper, where you can take a closer look at them, and really figure out which ones are better or worse.</p>
<p>So, don’t hold back, let it all just go everywhere, and clean things up afterwards.</p>
<p>The thing is, vomiting is really unpleasant. No one enjoys vomiting, even if it sometimes brings some relief to an upset stomach. It’s also involuntary and uncontrolled, rather than deliberate and skillful. You don’t need to practice vomiting to get good at it. (And the idea of being <em>good at vomiting</em> is also pretty weird itself!)</p>
<p>Talking with the students, I realized that <em>sketching</em> is a much better metaphor for my process of writing a first draft. As in, sketching a drawing or painting.</p>
<p>As in the vomiting metaphor, a sketch doesn’t tightly follow formal requirements. Indeed, the point of a sketch is often to figure out the general form and composition of the image. Sketching is done quickly and lightly, with lots of little changes along the way as you figure out what does and doesn’t work. A sketch might contain variations on an element, to identify which representations of that element are better and worse.</p>
<p>But, unlike vomiting, sketching is a deliberate and skillful activity. It requires practice, and can involve different techniques of varying complexity and effort. It’s also often pleasant and stimulating.</p>
<p>Consider this blog post. I’m taking time out of a very busy day to write it, because after class I just couldn’t get “vomiting vs.&nbsp;sketching” out of my head. I was too excited to find a way to explain this idea to other people. And, even more importantly, I needed to work out <em>for myself</em> exactly what I meant, why I thought sketching was a better metaphor for my writing process. As I write, I’m coming up with even more ideas, and what was meant to be about 300 words long is now creeping towards 500 (and beyond). When I vomit, I’m not excited to keep vomiting even more.</p>
<p>When we make a sketch — for a drawing, a painting, or a photograph or video shot — we start with a vague, poorly-defined concept or reaction to a scene. There’s <em>something</em> here we want to express, but usually we’re not really sure what that <em>something</em> is. Sketching is the process whereby we consider different elements, seen in different ways, arranged in different compositions, hopefully working our way towards that original <em>something</em>. When we find it — when the sketch is successful — it has a feeling of both creation and discovery. Creation because it’s a thing we’ve created, it’s emerged out of us and now exists in the world. But also discovery, because at the start we didn’t know exactly what that <em>something</em> was. The sketch reveals that <em>something</em> to us, enabling us to share it with others but also understand it better ourselves.</p>
<p>For me, philosophy also starts with that <em>something</em>, a vague reaction to the ideas of another. Sometimes it’s vague agreement; sometimes it’s vague disagreement. Most often it’s that I don’t quite see things the way the other person does, and the <em>something</em> is the combination of our agreements and disagreements. Writing — sketching — is the process by which I try to discover and explain that vague reaction.</p>
<p>This is what philosophers mean when we say that writing is our research method.</p>

  <title>Why aren’t Trump supporters worried about the Seal Team 6 Scenario? (Rejected from r/AskTrumpSupporters)</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2024-07-14-seal-team-6.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This was originally written as a Reddit post on July 5, about a week after the Trump v. US decision.</em></p>
<p>The “Seal Team 6 Scenario” is where the President orders an assassination of a political rival. Arguably, under the <em>Trump v. US</em> decision, this would fall within the President’s “core powers” as Commander in Chief, and so would be immune from any criminal prosecution. A lot of Trump opponents are worried about this scenario, but TS [Trump supporters] don’t seem to be. In the <em>Trump</em> decision, the majority just dismissed it as “hyperbolic,” without actually refuting the argument.</p>
<p>But it seems to me like TS <em>should</em> be worried about this kind of scenario:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A lot of TS believe that Democratic political leaders are/have been/will be willing to use antidemocratic/tyrannical/authoritarian measures to secure power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trump v. US</em> allows things like political assassination.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a Democratic president now, it’s a live possibility that we’ll have a Democratic president a year from now, and we’ll almost certainly have a Democratic president sooner or later.</p></li>
<li><p>So, from the perspective of a lot of TS, there’s a live possibility that, sooner or later, a Democratic political leader will use political assassination to secure power.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Live possibility” doesn’t mean it’s especially likely, just that it’s something that might foreseeably happen. Like, if Biden only has a 25% chance of legitimately winning the election (1:3 odds), he’s definitely not favored. But his chances are way better than rolling snake eyes on a pair of dice (1:35 odds, about 3% chance) or drawing two pair in poker (about 5% chance).</p>
<p>So if you’re not worried about the Seal Team 6 Scenario, where’s the misstep in my argument 1-4?</p>

<p>I’m somewhat active on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/">r/AskTrumpSupporters</a>. The board is intended to be a place where Trump supporters and critics can talk about the differences across their views. I don’t think it’s very successful at this, due to a combination of high rates of trolling by supporters and critics flooding supporters’ replies.</p>
<p>But I still sometimes try to post questions there. These are usually rejected. I’m not sure why, since I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/wiki/index/#wiki_posting_guidelines">try to follow the guidelines</a> and the mods don’t give any explanation for rejections. Since these posts take some effort, I thought I’d put them up here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>This post was originally written March 17, 2024</em></p>
<p>Were you aware that Democrats do not want to undermine democracy?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01594-w">this political science study</a>, they asked both Democrats and Republicans whether they would support take steps to undermine democracy if it hurt the other party, and then what they think members of the other party would support. They specifically asked about:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>reducing the number of voting stations</li>
<li>banning rallies</li>
<li>ignoring controversial court rulings</li>
<li>freezing the social media accounts of journalists</li>
<li>changing laws to make it easier for one’s own side to get elected</li>
<li>using violence to block laws</li>
<li>reinterpreting the Constitution to block policies</li>
</ol>
<p>For both Democrats and Republicans, the most common response to most items was that they would “never” support it, and 60-80% said they would “never or probably not” support it.*</p>
<p>So neither party supports undermining democracy. But each party thinks the other would support these things. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01594-w/figures/1">Figure 1</a> shows how dramatically we misunderstand each other. The authors argue that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This provides would-be authoritarians with a powerful weapon against democracy. They use propaganda to convince their supporters that the other side is undermining democracy. As their supporters come to believe that the other side is defecting, they are more willing to tolerate their leaders’ antidemocratic actions, which are seen as merely levelling the playing field now tilted against them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think of this?</p>
<p>* In <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41562-023-01594-w/MediaObjects/41562_2023_1594_MOESM1_ESM.pdf">the supplementary info</a>, you can see the breakdown of responses for individual items on pages 24-25. For Democrats, for two items “probably not” was more common than “never”: banning rallies by the far right and freezing the social media accounts of journalists. Except for banning rallies, no more than 30% of Democrats said they would “probably” or “definitely” support taking the step. For Republicans, “probably not” was more common than “never” for banning rallies by the far left and ignoring controversial court rulings.</p>

  <title>Defusing the Democracy Defense: Scientists as Epistemic Representatives</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2024-04-05-dewey-center-talk.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I gave a talk at the Center for Dewey Studies in Carbondale on April 4. Slides are <a href="https://epistemic-rep.netlify.app/">here</a>, the recording is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tKTnaKNt0Y">here</a>, and the abstract is below.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For decades, traditional notions of objectivity and ideals of politically neutral, “value-free” science have been challenged by the history, philosophy, and social studies of science. For most scholars in these fields, science is unavoidably “shot through with values,” and value-laden decisions appear throughout the “nooks and crannies” of everyday scientific research. But some have pushed back, arguing that accepting value-ladenness would allow scientists to undemocratically impose their values on everyone else. This is the “democracy defense” of value-free science.</p>
<p>One line of response to the democracy defense appeals to ideas of deliberative democracy, imagining increased public participation in science-based policymaking. But deliberative democratic approaches have difficulty reaching into the “nooks and crannies” of scientific research itself, where it would be impractical for scientists to consult with the public.</p>
<p>In this talk, I consider whether the theory of political representation might be useful for thinking about when and how the judgment of a select few can democratically represent the general public. In other words, can we think of scientists as epistemic representatives, more or less the way politicians serve as political representatives? I suggest that recent work in political theory, on informal representation and systems of democratic representation, are promising for such an approach.</p>

  <title>Epistemic interdependence or epistemic hierarchy</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-11-12-epistemic-interdependence.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Given my intests in public scientific controversies and the politics of expertise, it might be a little surprising that I don’t really find much of interest in the social epistemology literature on expertise. I was reading a social epistemology paper yesterday that helped me articulate one reason for this: how we frame the need for expertise.</p>
<hr>
<p>I frame this need in terms of <em>epistemic interdependence</em>. For example, when we started a unit on appeal to authority <a href="https://fairy-shrimp.netlify.app/09-expertise.html#epistemic-interdependence">in Critical Reasoning this semester</a>, I first estimated that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>it would take you about 17 million minutes, or about 287,000 hours, to read the entirety of Wikipedia. Working 24/7/365.26, that’s a bit less than 33 years. Working full time (40 hours/week for 50 weeks per year) it’s 143 years.</p>
<p>And that’s just for the brief, nontechnical summary of collective human knowledge in a single language.</p>
<p>Humans depend on each other in a variety of ways. We need others to take care of us when we’re young, sick, and elderly. We distribute the work of making useful things across different job categories and industries, along with the work of getting useful things from the places they’re made to the places where they’re used. We’re also <strong>epistemically interdependent</strong>: we rely on each other to produce and circulate knowledge about the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, there’s so much to know that one person can’t do it all. We need other people to know things on our behalf. Experts are the people to whom we entrust this knowing. I go on to introduce <a href="https://fairy-shrimp.netlify.app/09-expertise.html#two-sources-of-expertise">two sources of expertise</a>, formal education or training and lived experience. Taking into account lived experience, most people have expertise in something, though often the scope is very local. I give the example of one of the nieces, who has expertise in the social groups of her high school. One student suggested that her mom has expertise in the mystery novels written by her favorite author. I also talk about ACT-UP and environmental justice movements, as examples of marginalized people — generally completely lacking formal training in science — who became scientific experts.</p>
<p>The examples of ACT-UP and environmental justice also motivate a key distinction in feminist accounts of trustworthiness <span class="citation" data-cites="AlmassiRelationallyResponsiveExpert2022">(Almassi 2022)</span>, between <a href="https://fairy-shrimp.netlify.app/09-expertise.html#act-up-and-unresponsive-experts">competence and responsiveness</a>: during the HIV-AIDS crisis, public health authorities were entirely competent credentialed experts, but were unresponsive to the concerns of ACT-UP and consequently were not trustworthy. We can same basically the same thing about EPA and environmental justice communities.</p>
<p>In this framing, I’m assuming that most people have more or less the same potential or “innate capacity” for expertise. The difference between credentialed experts and groups like ACT-UP is primarily the accident of privilege vs.&nbsp;marginalization, and even marginalized groups can successfully challenge credentialed experts in highly technical domains — though this probably requires a lot of organization and hard work, and will be of very restricted scope.<sup>1</sup></p>
<hr>
<p>By contrast, here’s how <span class="citation" data-cites="GrundmannFacingEpistemicAuthorities2021">Grundmann (2021)</span> frames expertise:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Epistemic abilities are unequally distributed in society. Not everyone has the same cognitive competences. Some people stand out by being much more reliable than average …. Epistemic superiority is the product of two independent factors: the available body of evidence and one’s reasoning competences …. Some people have a more reliable judgment than others because they are more clever in drawing rational inferences from the shared body of evidence. This is, e.g., the case when Sherlock Holmes outperforms Watson in his judgments about who was the murderer. <span class="citation" data-cites="GrundmannFacingEpistemicAuthorities2021">(Grundmann 2021, 138–39)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Call this framing <em>epistemic hierarchy</em>. Given a set of evidence, this framing suggests that we can rank people in order of their “cognitive competences,” and the experts are the ones with the best/most/greatest cognitive competence. This hierarchical framing is reinforced by referring to non-experts as “laypeople,” evoking the formal hierarchy of the Catholic church.</p>
<p>Grundmann does qualify this hierarchical framing, noting that “epistemic superiority … is always relative to a domain of expertise” (ibid.), and of course often some people will have access to more or better evidence than others. But these qualifications are often quietly dropped or bracketed. Grundmann defines “epistemic authority” with respect to domain D; but then refers to “superior reasoning competences” simpliciter, that is, not <em>domain-specific</em> reasoning competences. The definition also requires that the candidate authority “has very likely considered all of [the trustor’s] relevant evidence” (ibid.) By dropping these qualifications — and using Sherlock Holmes as the paradigm of an expert — this framing tends to suggest that expertise is primarily a matter of cognitive competence. And, further, seeing cognitive competence as “unequally distributed in society” suggests to me that cognitive competence — and thus expertise — is primarily a matter of innate “general intelligence.”<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> In short, with this framing, it seems to me quite easy to slide from domain-specific and dynamic comparisons that might not form a total order (A has better evidence, B has better domain-specific reasoning) to a domain-general epistemic hierarchy based on an innate ability.</p>
<p>(I want to stress that the implicatures and slides I see in the last paragraph aren’t logical entailments. I’m not claiming that, if you adopt this framing, you’re thereby committed to some sort of epistemic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being">scala natura</a>. My point is more that this framing coheres with the idea of a natural hierarchy based on intelligence, and can easily be read as either assuming or justifying such a hierarchy.)</p>
<p>Working with the epistemic hierarchy framing, <span class="citation" data-cites="GrundmannFacingEpistemicAuthorities2021">Grundmann (2021)</span> goes on to argue for the “Preemption View” of “layperson”-expert relations:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When we discover that an epistemic authority believes that p, we should not make any more use of our own reasoning about p as evidence for or against p.&nbsp;The use of our own reasoning concerning p is to be bracketed. <span class="citation" data-cites="GrundmannFacingEpistemicAuthorities2021">(Grundmann 2021, 140)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the “layperson” should defer to the expert’s judgment, and in particular should not challenge the expert’s reasoning, because of the expert’s superior cognitive capabilities (within the domain, and given that the expert has a superset of the layperson’s evidence). I didn’t read the rest of the paper carefully, but from here <span class="citation" data-cites="GrundmannFacingEpistemicAuthorities2021">Grundmann (2021)</span> seems to argue that a failure to follow the Preemption View explains why we have a problem with conspiracy theories and rampant misinformation.</p>
<p>It’s hard to read the cases of ACT-UP, environmental justice, or feminist history of science into this analysis. I suppose one could say that the marginalized groups in each case had access to evidence that the purported authority did not, or the purported authorities neglected relevant evidence, or something like this; and thus they were not actually authorities. But then the whole analysis of <span class="citation" data-cites="GrundmannFacingEpistemicAuthorities2021">Grundmann (2021)</span> is irrelevant, in a strictly logical sense: an early premise in the big argument (145) is false and so we get no particular guidance on these kinds of cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>One additional contrast between these framings seems noteworthy. Epistemic interdependence lends itself to posing the “question of expertise” in terms of trust: who should I trust (or) who is trustworthy? Starting by asking about trust, and reflecting on trust and vulnerability — in the footsteps of feminist philosophers — can lead us to a conception of trustworthiness that requires responsiveness along with (epistemic) competence. Expertise is a power relation, and the people with power (experts) can cause great harm when they abuse this power or use it to perpetrate injustice.</p>
<p>The epistemic hierarchy framing seems to understand the “question of expertise” in terms of the doxastic attitude that an (abstracted) agent should take towards an (abstracted) proposition: should S believe that p? Specifically, should S believe that p on the grounds that this other person A says so? Insofar as the ultimate virtue of belief is truth, the ultimate virtue of an expert is whether their claims are more likely to be true. Unless they can be reframed in terms of truth,<sup>4</sup> questions of power, vulnerability, and justice are lost in the brilliant glare cast by truth.</p>
<p>So this is one major reason why so much of the social epistemology literature leaves me cold. Not only does it deploy a rival framing of the question of expertise — with some implicatures that I find highly disagreeable — but, within this framing, it’s difficult to explore the kinds of cases that motivate me and ask the kinds of questions that I want to ask.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This point didn’t come up in class, but we could also say that queer communities often had expertise in <em>what it’s like to life with HIV-AIDS</em> that public health authorities generally lacked. The epistemic interdependence runs both ways; no party has uniformly better knowledge than any other party.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>A dedicated Holmes fan might object that Holmes’ abilities were much more dependent on domain-specific reasoning and a vast mental storehouse of esoteric evidence than “innate general intelligence.” This is correct; I vaguely recall a scene in which Watson is surprised that Holmes doesn’t know some commonplace fact (maybe Holmes doesn’t recognize the name of a popular opera singer?), and Holmes explains that he is intentionally ignorant of basically everything that’s not relevant to solving crime. But I would argue that Doyle also portrays Holmes’ capabilities as a matter of innate general intelligence — for example, his brother Mycroft has the same innate genius, just applied to national security and espionage — and the <em>popular</em> understanding of Holmes emphasizes his supposed innate general intelligence.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I’ve also spent a lot of time the last 2-1/2 year working on a project on race science, which might make me oversensitive to the possibility that ideas of innate general intelligence are waiting just offstage.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Fact checking ChatGPT: An activity for Critical Thinking</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-11-10-ChatGPT.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week I did a “fact checking ChatGPT” activity with my Critical Thinking class. It has some distinct aims from other ChatGPT activities I’ve seen, and seemed to work well, so I thought I’d write it up real quick.</p>
<p>I’ve seen lots of examples of classroom activities that explore the limitations (and strengths) of ChatGPT as a writer. Some of my students mentioned they or their friends had done things like this. For this activity, I decided to focus instead on ChatGPT as a source of information. We’ve just spent three weeks learning how to evaluate other sources: <a href="https://fairy-shrimp.netlify.app/09-expertise.html">a unit on appeals to authority</a> based on <a href="https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-09-25-teaching-expertise.html">feminist work on epistemic trustworthiness</a>, and then <a href="https://fairy-shrimp.netlify.app/11-SIFT-1.html">a unit on fact checking (social) media using the SIFT method</a>.</p>
<p>To prepare for the activity, I asked students to create an OpenAI account if they didn’t already have one, and bring their laptops to class if they don’t usually do so. I also told them to read Ted Chiang’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">essay</a> “ChatGPT is a Blurry JPEG of the Web,” and set up the Google Sheet that’s linked below.</p>
<p>Then, in class, I gave students these instructions for the activity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Prompt ChatGPT to write a short paper on a topic that includes citations and a bibliography: &gt; Hi ChatGPT. Can you write a short paper on the rise of college debt, including a bibliography with five recent academic citations?</p></li>
<li><p>For each bibliography entry, use search tools to try to determine whether the item actually exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the author list match what ChatGPT said?</li>
<li>Was it published in the place ChatGPT said it was published?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Record your findings on this Google Sheet: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2xdcz7mo">tinyurl.com/2xdcz7mo</a></p></li>
</ol>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://dhicks.github.io/img/2023-11-10-ChatGPT-spreadsheet.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>The first few rows of the spreadsheet</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The spreadsheet was set to “anyone can edit.” I filled in the first few rows myself as an example, using the citations from the essay ChatGPT generated in response to my college debt prompt. Columns C, E, and F (does the item exist, does the author list match, does the publication info match) use data validation rules, restricting the possible values. This makes it simple to set up the pivot table in the “exists?” sheet, which we use in the debrief/reflection phase.</p>
<p>The prompt needs to request citations and a bibliography explicitly; otherwise ChatGPT doesn’t include them. This might be different if you’re using something like Microsoft Bing Chat.</p>
<p>After walking through the instructions abstractly, I gave a short demonstration by repeating the work I’d done with the first couple of rows. This included a quick reminder of Google Scholar, which a student had mentioned a few weeks earlier when we were discussing expertise.</p>
<p>Students spent about 40 minutes working on this activity, mostly in pairs or individually. I said explicitly that I wanted to get as large a sample of bib items as possible, and so didn’t want them to work in their table-groups (5-8 students). It was a nice, chill, student-oriented class session: I just wandered around, answering questions, helping with the rare tricky case, and chatting with students.</p>
<p>To close out the activity, I spent 15 minutes on a whole-class discussion of three questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How frequently did ChatGPT manufacture citations?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this relate to Chiang’s essay, “ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web”?</p></li>
<li><p>What implications does this have for using LLMs like ChatGPT</p>
<ul>
<li>To write papers?</li>
<li>As information sources (Google Bard, Microsoft Bing Chat)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Question 1 was easy to answer with the pivot table. In our case, ChatGPT manufactured 38% of citations (counting only the ones that do not exist at all) or 58% (including the ones that exist but have metadata errors). A few students said this is what they expected to see — based on doing some similar experiments on their own — but I and other students expected the rate of manufactured citations to be somewhat higher.</p>
<p>Not many of the students had really digested Chiang’s essay, so this turned into an impromptu lecture. We’re covering argument by analogy next week, so I’ll probably use Chiang’s analogy as a recurrent example.</p>
<p>Students were pretty thoughtful about the implications. We talked about how faculty are experts, and can instantly recognize manufactured citations in our areas of expertise. Students were a little uncertain about how to regard the citations that actually existed. Some felt these were reliable, but others made the inference that you’d have to actually go and read the paper itself to figure out whether it made the claims ChatGPT was attributing to it. In their one-minute papers, lots of students indicated that they no longer trust ChatGPT as a source of information.</p>
<p>All together, this activity went really well: students were very engaged, and came away with a healthy skepticism of LLMs. Next time, I might make the spreadsheet-filling itself homework rather than an in-class activity. Specifically, I might devote the last 15-20 minutes of the previous session to getting student started on filling in the spreadsheet, then have them complete it (for two different prompts) before the next session. Then, in “the ChatGPT session proper,” we’d start with 10 minutes or so on any tricky references, and have about an hour for the reflective discussion. This would give us lots of time to unpack Chinag’s essay and relate it to the results of the fact check.</p>
<hr>
<p>Coincidentally, this morning <em>Nature</em> published a very nice Perspective piece that proposes two non-anthropomorphic conceptual frameworks for thinking about the behavior of LLMs <span class="citation" data-cites="ShanahanRolePlayLarge2023">(Shanahan, McDonell, and Reynolds 2023)</span>. Their second framework is a bit technical for the typical first-year undergrad. But the first framework is very accessible: LLMs as role-playing, or specifically as actors in an improv show.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If the model has generalized well from the training data, the most plausible continuation [of the prompt text] will be a response to the user that conforms to the expectations we would have of someone who fits the description in the preamble. In other words, the dialogue agent will do its best to role-play the character of a dialogue agent as portrayed in the dialogue prompt ….</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What sorts of roles might the agent begin to take on? This is determined in part, of course, by the tone and subject matter of the ongoing conversation. But it is also determined, in large part, by the panoply of characters that feature in the training set, which encompasses a multitude of novels, screenplays, biographies, interview transcripts, newspaper articles and so on. In effect, the training set provisions the language model with a vast repertoire of archetypes and a rich trove of narrative structure on which to draw as it ‘chooses’ how to continue a conversation, refining the role it is playing as it goes, while staying in character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like an experienced improv actor, a LLM is able to adopt the distinctive behaviors of the role they’re playing, making the role very convincing. But — when playing the role of an expert — this doesn’t come with the competence required for actual expertise. An actor can play an expert in starship engineering, for example, saying the kinds of things we’d expect starship engineers to say (based on decades of fiction featuring starship engineer characters), without any actual knowledge of starship engineering. Similarly, a LLM can convincingly say the kinds of things that we expect student loan experts to say — including producing the kinds of citations that student loan experts use in their papers — without any actual knowledge of student loans.</p>

  <title>Teaching ethics of expertise in Critical Thinking</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-09-25-teaching-expertise.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m teaching expertise and appeals to authority in Critical Thinking about a month, and start to wrestle yet again with how to approach this.</p>
<p>The textbook I use — like pretty much all of them? — takes the “believe the impartial sources who have the right credentials” approach. Completely out of touch with five decades of feminist philosophy and STS.</p>
<p>I want to start by talking about multiple sources of expertise (credentials, but also lived experience), then Baier’s conception of trust and subsequent work on the ethics+epistemology of trust. Using Baier’s conception suggests two relatively clear criteria for a trustworthy expert:</p>
<dl>
<dt>competence</dt>
<dd>
On the topic in question, the expert is likely to have true beliefs.
</dd>
<dt>responsiveness</dt>
<dd>
“[T]hey have encapsulated my interests: the trusted party pursues or protects particular interests, at least in part, because they are the trusted party’s interests …. the expectation that the [expert] will be directly and favorably moved by the thought that we are counting on her” <span class="citation" data-cites="AlmassiRelationallyResponsiveExpert2022">(Almassi 2022, 578)</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>From here we can talk about why different groups of people can reasonably assess the trustworthiness of experts differently. And <span class="citation" data-cites="AlmassiRelationallyResponsiveExpert2022">Almassi (2022)</span> has a really nice argument that “owning the libs” — communicating that one is actively hostile towards an outgroup — isn’t actually evidence that they’re interested in promoting the ingroup’s interests, and thus does not make them more trustworthy for members of the ingroup. Which will nicely fit into our discussion, over the subsequent two weeks, of the SIFT method for assessing online information sources and then whether ChatGPT is trustworthy (spoiler alert: it is not).</p>
<p>So class time looks good. Where I’m feeling uncertainty is in assessment.</p>
<p>In this class, the discrete course units are assessed using a weekly quiz. The quiz has a simple format: students are given an argument as a paragraph of prose, and then have to answer a series of short response questions that walk them through analyzing the argument. The short response questions are explicitly tied to “rules” that the textbook gives for assessing that type of argument. In theory, this direct line between assessments and course content will help students study. For example, last year’s course used this question to get at competence:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the source’s area of expertise? Is this credentialed or experiential expertise? (Rule 14)</p>
<p>Expectations: 1 sentence characterizing area and source of expertise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A typical prompt/argument to analyze for this unit goes like this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Massimiliano Vasile, an aerospace engineer at the University of Glasgow, spent two years comparing nine different technologies that could be used if an asteroid were on a collision course with Earth. Dr.&nbsp;Vasile’s study revealed that it would be a bad idea to blow up an incoming asteroid with nuclear weapons. Thus, blowing up Earth-bound asteroids with nuclear weapons is a bad idea. <span class="small">(Adapted from: Lia Miller, “The Best Way to Deflect an Asteroid,” New York Times Magazine, December 9, 2007, &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/ 09_5_asteroid.html&gt;)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prompts like this contain no useful information for assessing responsiveness. Examples of appeal to expertise like this “seem to treat our communities of inquirers rather generically …. experts’ particular relationship to us … is elided, treated as irrelevant to the question at hand” <span class="citation" data-cites="AlmassiRelationallyResponsiveExpert2022">(Almassi 2022, 578)</span>.</p>
<p>Some prompts do give negative information, indications that the expert is not responsive to our interests, in the form of indicators that the source has a financial conflict of interest, “four out of five doctors smoke Camels.” That’s something, but I don’t want to reduce responsiveness to a question about conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>I need 7 of these prompts (there’s a new quiz each week, so students can re-take them until they pass). Scrapping them all — or almost all of them — and writing whole new ones would be a lot of work. If I have to go actively looking, it can take 60-90 minutes to find a good example — usually from a piece of science journalism — and distill it into a single, undergrad-accessible paragraph.</p>
<p>My dilemma is this: Stick with an inadequate approach to expertise, or put in an extra 7-10 hours of work to rewrite the quizzes?</p>

  <title>Do scientists have power? Does science?</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-09-20-power.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I recently read (most of) <span class="citation" data-cites="LukesPowerRadicalView2005">Lukes (2005)</span>. Lukes offers an influential account of (political) power, and I wanted to see if it would be useful for answering a question that came up in a discussion with (IIRC) Heather Douglas and Matt Brown quite a while ago: Do scientists have power?</p>
<p>Lukes identifies three “faces” of power. Unless I missed something, his definitions for these “faces” aren’t very clear; they’re often demonstrative or negative. And he doesn’t label them. So here’s a quick attempt at labeled, positive definitions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>coercive</dt>
<dd>
This is what we usually think of as political power: comply or you will be harmed.
</dd>
<dt>prioritizing</dt>
<dd>
Influencing whose interests have priority, are seen as important and should be protected or promoted. Lukes talks about this with respect to agenda-setting, as in whose complaints show up on the agenda.
</dd>
<dt>ideological</dt>
<dd>
Influencing how interests are recognized and understood. In terms of Brown’s Deweyan model of inquiry <span class="citation" data-cites="BrownScienceMoralImagination2020">(Brown 2020)</span>, ideological power shapes not only how a problem is framed, but potentially also <em>whether a situation is experienced as indeterminate or problematic in the first place</em>.
</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<p>Given these definitions, do scientists have power?</p>
<p>As posed, the question is ambiguous, between individualistic and corporate readings of “scientists.” Let’s use “scientists” for the individualistic reading (do certain particular scientists have power?) and “science” for the corporate reading (does science as an institution have power?)</p>
<p>Individual scientists basically never have coercive power. Even when a scientist, qua scientist, works for the state, the role of scientist doesn’t come with law enforcement powers or some other entitlement to coercive power.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individual scientists can have prioritizing and ideological power. In the risk assessment framework, the first phase is “problem formulation and scoping,” which is supposed to be on the “politics” side of the science/politics dichotomy. But typically risk assessment is initiated in response to scientific findings — findings made, communicated, and taken up by certain particular scientists, qua scientists — that indicate a problem and its potential severity.</p>
<p>In these kinds of cases, individual scientists generally won’t have <em>exclusive</em> prioritizing and ideological power. At EPA or other regulatory agencies, certain particular political appointees and “regulatory” (as opposed to “scientific”) staff will also exercise these forms of power.</p>
<p>And, outside of regulatory agencies, individual scientists often do not have any more prioritizing or ideological power than any other member of the public. Well-connected faculty at prestigious universities might be able to exercise this kind of power. (I’m thinking of Scott Atlas, a Hoover Institution fellow who was on Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, or the psychologist Arthur Jensen, who was a professor at Berkeley and became well-know to the public for his race science views.)</p>
<p>So, academic scientists, <em>as individuals</em>, generally don’t have much of any of the three forms of power.</p>
<hr>
<p>Turn now to science in the corporate sense, and specifically institutions that are taken to speak on behalf of science: EPA, IPCC, the National Academies, AAAS.</p>
<p>Regulatory agencies, like EPA, do have coercive power. Though the prioritizing and ideological power of regulated industries means that EPA doesn’t exercise that coercive power as much as I would like. Still, insofar as EPA is a representative of “science,” and does exercise coercive power, we can understand this as science exercising (and therefore having) coercive power.</p>
<p>The other science institutions that I listed above don’t have coercive power. But they do have substantial prioritizing and ideological power. The National Academies basically made up the risk assessment framework, which is a fundamental component of how environmental health threats are understood and prioritized. Indeed, even the category label “environmental health threats” adopts some assumptions of the risk assessment framework. Opponents of genetically modified foods have a number of concerns that aren’t related to health and safety <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksGMOsNonhealthIssues2016">(Hicks and Millstein 2016)</span> and are therefore systematically ignored by regulatory agencies <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksGeneticallyModifiedCrops2017">(Hicks 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Using Lukes’ terminology, a whole strain of STS is devoted to studying the prioritizing and ideological power of scientism: on the assumption that only “scientific” evidence counts as evidence, claims that a situation is problematic, is sufficiently severe and warrants action, and that the key cause of the problem is such-and-such, all need to be justified by “scientific” evidence <span class="citation" data-cites="WynneSheepfarmingChernobylCase1989 EpsteinImpureScience1996 FrickelUndoneScienceCharting2010 KleinmanHoneyBeesThreat2013 SuryanarayananVanishingBeesScience2016">(Wynne 1989; Epstein 1996; Frickel et al. 2010; Kleinman and Suryanarayanan 2013; Suryanarayanan and Kleinman 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Scientism has this power because it serves the interests of multiple groups. Most obviously it bolsters the status of scientists. It was taken up by regulatory agencies as a strategy to maintain legitimacy in the face of opposition from regulated industries <span class="citation" data-cites="JasanoffFifthBranchScience1998">(Jasanoff 1998)</span>. But, at the same time, regulated industries have used it to dismiss criticism and block or delay regulation <span class="citation" data-cites="MichaelsDoubtTheirProduct2008">(Michaels 2008)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we think of political power only in coercive terms, then it’s difficult to come up with examples of the political power of science beyond agencies like EPA. <span class="citation" data-cites="LukesPowerRadicalView2005">Lukes (2005)</span> is explicitly challenging a parallel situation in mid-century political science: a line of research that studied “power,” but understood it only as coercive power, and generally came to the conclusion that there are not significant concentrations of power in American politics. He identified prioritization power in some previous research, and proposed ideological power as all but completely overlooked by empirical political scientists.</p>
<p>When we follow Lukes in thinking of power in terms of shaping the agenda and framing the recognition and understanding of problematic situations, then it’s much easier to articulate the political power of science. Science has power not because it can threaten you with imprisonment, but rather because problems that aren’t articulated and diagnosed “scientifically” are systematically ignored.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">Lewandowsky et al. (2022)</span> examine public scientific controversies through two contrasting “lenses” or analytical frameworks, using Covid-19 as their primary case study. The first lens, “science denial,” is pretty explicitly scientistic: in cases such as “the link between AIDS and HIV, climate change, evolution, and other clearly established scientific facts,”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>absent new evidence, dissent from the scientifically accepted position cannot be supported by legitimate evidence and theorizing but must necessarily—that is, in virtually all instances—involve misleading or flawed argumentation. <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 31)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some qualifiers in this particular quotation — “absent new evidence” and “<em>virtually</em> all instances” — but in other places these are dropped: “The rules of scientific evidence formation and argumentation are inescapable and cannot be discarded or side-stepped for political expediency” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 32)</span> This lens explains public scientific controversies by appealing to a combination of irrationality and disinformation/propaganda.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">Lewandowsky et al. (2022)</span> recognize the technocratic implications of the “science denial” lens:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>this insistence on quality of argumentation may seemingly curtail the public’s involvement in any scientifically informed debate. After all, members of the public are often nonexperts on topics and issues whose outcomes affect their lives. <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 32)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their first “solution” to this problem is to communicate “scientific issues” using “stories or pictures” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 32)</span>. The second “solution” is a segue into the second lens.</p>
<hr>
<p>The “trust” lens explains controversies by appealing to the ways that “people differ in how much trust they put on various information sources (e.g., scientists vs.&nbsp;their neighbor on social media)” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 33)</span>. Further, the lens recognizes that differences in trust can be due to differences in <em>trustworthiness</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Ethnic minorities, for example, have historically been discriminated against in the health care system. Western countries, especially those with colonial histo- ries, have also damaged people’s trust in medical treatments through their previ- ous mistreatment of indigenous populations (Lowes and Montero 2021) and misuse of vaccination centers, for example, by the CIA in its hunt for Osama bin Laden (Reardon 2011). <strong>It is unsurprising that people would question scientific evidence communicated by the same institutions that caused them harm or deceived them in the past</strong> (Jamison, Quinn, and Freimuth 2019). <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 33, my emphasis)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To elaborate this a little more, it might be helpful to make a three-way distinction, between (a) (occurrent) trust, (b) perceived trustworthiness, and (c) actual trustworthiness. A potential trustee might satisfy criteria for trustworthiness, but be incorrectly perceived to be untrustworthy by the potential trustor. For example, under the influence of politicization campaigns, many US conservatives might incorrectly believe climate scientists to be more interested in their own careers than the public interest, and thus incorrectly perceive climate scientists to be untrustworthy.</p>
<p>The “trust” lens implies that “appreciation of why evidence is mistrusted in these communities is essential” and the importance of “regain[ing] trust rather than dismiss[ing] beliefs based on lived experience as simple denialism” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 33)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">Lewandowsky et al. (2022)</span> attempt to bring these two lenses together. Understanding why a group’s “cultural background or lived experience” undermines the trustworthiness of mainstream institutions “can provide pointers as to why [they] engage[] in (or fall[] for)” irrationality and disinformation <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 34)</span>. In addition (or perhaps “specifically”), understanding the causes of trustworthiness failures “can reveal shortcomings in the scientific process or evidence base …. analysis of those arguments can provide valuable pointers to underlying issues—such as lacking representation in medical research—that can be addressed by suitable policies or remedial research” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 34)</span>.</p>
<p>I would add that the example of incorrectly perceiving climate scientists to be untrustworthy suggests that perceived untrustworthiness and misinformation can be co-producing. Climate propagandists have not only promulgated “first order” misinformation about climate change (“it’s all natural variation”) but also “second order” misinformation about climate <em>scientists</em> (“they’ll say whatever it takes to get published”).</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, in their final section, “Recommendations,” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">Lewandowsky et al. (2022)</span> seem to revert back to the “science denial” lens alone. Their two primary recommendations are that “misleading and inappropriate argumentation must be identified” and that “when misleading arguments have been identified, they can be used to ‘inoculate’ the public against their ill effects” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 35)</span>. The “trust” lens’ emphasis on understanding why scientific institutions might not be (perceived to be) trustworthy has all but disappeared. The “trust” lens does get one paragraph, arguing that “Policies that take into account the reasons underlying misleading arguments can be more effective than those agnostic about these reasons” and that emphasizing “‘winning’ an argument” is unlikely to be successful” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 35)</span>. But the final sentence asserts that deliberation “can be achieved” “only when misleading arguments can be identified and rejected” <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyWhenScienceBecomes2022">(Lewandowsky et al. 2022, 35)</span>, that is, only when “science” wins the argument.</p>
<hr>
<p>I really like the way this piece contrasts two common frameworks for understanding public scientific controversies. The scientistic and technocratic implications of the “science denial”/misinformation framework are on full display, which is useful for illustrating why I typically dislike this framework and find it, at best, incomplete. And the attempt to synthesize the two frameworks is useful: as you can see, it prompted me to think about how I understand the role of propaganda and misinformation in my analysis of controversies.</p>
<p>But that “Recommendations” section. To me, the paper reads like there were two sets of authors here. One set working with the misinfo framework, the other with the trustworthiness framework. The trustworthiness folks made a reasonable effort to integrate trustworthiness and misinformation in their section. But the misinfo folks ignored this, relying just on their framework to write the concluding section.</p>

  <title>Revisiting the Nazi Problem</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-06-07-nazi-problem.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In theory this will be a quick post. In theory.</p>
<p>At a conference a couple of weeks ago, I was talking (read: complaining) about how, as far as I’m aware, no one has ever really responded to the “Nazi Problem,” a concern about Longino’s conception of objectivity raised by Natalia Baeza in a grad seminar she and I took with Janet Kourany at Notre Dame circa 2007 and that I wrote up in my first publication a few years later <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksLonginoConceptionObjectivity2011">(Hicks 2011)</span>. Yet, with the revitalization of race science over the last 8 years or so, the Nazi Problem is even more urgent today than it was in 2007-ish. Heather Douglas told me she had a brief solution in a recent paper of hers <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasDifferentiatingScientificInquiry2023">(Douglas 2023)</span>. In this post, after summarizing the Nazi Problem, I’ll present Douglas’ solution and my response.</p>
<p>A key implication of Longino’s conception of objectivity is that it requires the active cultivation of a wide range of perspectives, in order to ensure the critical scrutiny of implicit assumptions made by the scientific mainstream. For Longino this provides an epistemic argument for the active cultivation of women (feminist) and POC (antiracist) scientists. The “Nazi Problem” is that this reasoning seems to apply equally to Nazi/sexist/racist scientists, and therefore it seems that Longino’s account of objectivity requires actively cultivating them as well.</p>
<p>The primary solution to the Nazi Problem that I consider in the paper<sup>1</sup> was to point out an incompatibility between the political liberalism built into Longino’s account — ideas like formal (epistemic) equality — and Nazi anti-liberalism. A sexist can’t authentically comply with norms that require them to treat women as equals, and so we just qualify Longino’s account by saying that it doesn’t require the active cultivation of inauthentic perspectives. On the few occasions where people have responded to the Nazi Problem in print, this is the response they give <span class="citation" data-cites="RolinCanSocialDiversity2017">(for example, Rolin 2017, 123–24)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem with this response, for me, is that it also rules out feminist standpoint theory. Because they think certain standpoints are epistemically advantaged, standpoint theorists also can’t authentically comply with norms that require them to treat disadvantaged standpoints as formal epistemic equals. I make a similar point about the commitment to neutrality between comprehensive conceptions of the good life and communitarian feminists.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasDifferentiatingScientificInquiry2023">Douglas (2023)</span>’s response to the Nazi Problem is raised in the context of identifying some key differences between inquiry (science) and democratic politics. A key contribution in this paper is the notion of <em>inquirer façades</em>, “faking one of the central norms of inquiry without following through on its demands.” Douglas proposes that “When inquirer facades are discovered, they can be legitimately ignored by those within the space of inquiry” <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasDifferentiatingScientificInquiry2023">(Douglas 2023, 133)</span>.<sup>2</sup> Here’s Douglas on the Nazi Problem:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One might worry, though, that fostering diversity can include bringing into the space of inquiry ideological views impervious to criticism (Hicks, 2011). However, if we keep in mind that all participants in the space of inquiry must be responsive to criticism (norm 2), this concern is alleviated. The ideologically pre-committed cannot survive the demands of criticism and response for long, revealing the fact that they are inquirer facades and thus can be legitimately ignored within the space of inquiry. <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasDifferentiatingScientificInquiry2023">(Douglas 2023, 136)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have four comments. My first point is that Douglas has reframed the Nazi Problem in terms of closed-mindedness or “dogmatism.”<sup>3</sup> But, like <span class="citation" data-cites="AlcoffCommentaryElizabethAnderson2006">Alcoff (2006)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="YapFeministRadicalEmpiricism2015">Yap (2015)</span>, I don’t regard closed-mindedness as such a severe vice. As Yap puts it, “values such as respecting women’s autonomy and self-determination should be seen as basic commitments and not ‘up for grabs’ in the same kind of way” as our taste in music <span class="citation" data-cites="YapFeministRadicalEmpiricism2015">(Yap 2015, 5)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, rather than thinking the problem with Nazis is that they’re closed-minded, the problem with Nazis is that they’re Nazis. They hold odious racist, sexist, and anti-democratic beliefs, and often embrace offensive political violence as a means of achieving political power.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Third, the history of behavior genetics shows how a scientific community can protect racists and sexists by deflecting values-based critique while still responding to technical criticism <span class="citation" data-cites="PanofskyMisbehavingScienceControversy2014">(Panofsky 2014)</span>. Panofsky argues that, prior to Jensen’s 1969 “How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?” paper, behavior geneticists explicitly marginalized eugenics and race science, with the goal of avoiding controversy and having their work compared to Nazi race science <span class="citation" data-cites="PanofskyMisbehavingScienceControversy2014">(Panofsky 2014 ch.&nbsp;2)</span>. Consequently many behavior geneticists were at least deeply uncomfortable with the controversy (and Nazi comparisons) that Jensen attracted <span class="citation" data-cites="PanofskyMisbehavingScienceControversy2014">(Panofsky 2014, 80)</span>. However, in reaction to broad criticisms of behavior genetics <em>as such</em> by Lewontin, Kamin, and other critics, behavior geneticists adopted a kind of fortress mentality — with the field under constant threat of repression by political radicals <span class="citation" data-cites="PanofskyMisbehavingScienceControversy2014">(Panofsky 2014, 114)</span> — along with an “absolutist interpretation of intellectual freedom” that did not include any sense of social responsibility for, for example, racist appropriations of behavior genetics research <span class="citation" data-cites="PanofskyMisbehavingScienceControversy2014">(Panofsky 2014, 194–97)</span>. At the same time, behavior geneticists — including those who continue to study intelligence and race — have at least somewhat engaged with technical critiques, at least nominally rejecting a strong hereditarianism in favor of gene-environment interactions, and shifting from twin studies to GWAS (genome-wide association studies) and polygenic indices as genomics technology has developed <span class="citation" data-cites="PanofskyMisbehavingScienceControversy2014">(Panofsky 2014 ch.&nbsp;6)</span>. These changes in the field are regarded as inadequate by many critics, both internal <span class="citation" data-cites="TurkheimerThisTimeMean2022">(Turkheimer 2022)</span> and external <span class="citation" data-cites="DownesChangesHeritabilityUnpredictable2022">(Downes and Kaplan 2022)</span>. But they do give behavior geneticists ground — however thin — to claim that race-and-intelligence researchers are responsive to criticism.</p>
<p>More generally, if Longino’s account can justify excluding Nazis who are closed-minded and/or not responsive to criticism, it would still seem to require actively cultivating Nazis, so long as they’re open-minded and engage in uptake. And, over the past decade or so, right-wing intellectuals and provocateurs — including proponents of race science — have adopted at least the posture of open-mindedness and the value of debate and free speech <span class="citation" data-cites="RobinCriticClownTale2017 ReiheldGimletEyeJournal2018 TaylorFreeSpeechHypocrisy2018">(Robin 2017; Reiheld 2018; Taylor 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Fourth and finally, I didn’t develop my own solution to the Nazi Problem in <span class="citation" data-cites="HicksLonginoConceptionObjectivity2011">Hicks (2011)</span>. A decade and change later, my own solution would align with Douglas’ recognition that “Both societal and epistemic responsibilities generate reasons for excluding some topics and methods from legitimate inquiry” <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasDifferentiatingScientificInquiry2023">(Douglas 2023, 129)</span>. Indeed, Douglas discusses the case of behavior genetics:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Current debates over restraints often combine moral, political, and epistemic concerns. Consider the debate over the legitimacy of research on race-based or gender-based intelligence. The history of such work has been so consistently shoddy that doubts have been raised about whether this is an epistemically productive line of inquiry (Rose, 2009). Further, <strong>it has been so socially harmful that it may not be unreasonable to declare such work outside the space of legitimate inquiry at this point</strong> (Kourany, 2016). Merely pointing to generic scientific freedom or the need to pursue truth is inadequate in the face of these concerns (Ceci &amp; Williams, 2009). Well-formed and reasoned restraints on the space of inquiry have a long history of legitimacy. <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasDifferentiatingScientificInquiry2023">(Douglas 2023, 130–31, my emphasis)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve emphasized the moral argument, which comes closest to the grounds on which I would exclude racists and sexists. But rather than the downstream social harms of research, I would point directly to the racism and sexism itself. These values — and acting in line with them — are odious and not to be tolerated <span class="citation" data-cites="SchroederLimitsDemocratizingScience2022">(Schroeder 2022)</span>. Nearly 80 years after the formal demise of Nazism, there is good reason why it is almost universally reviled.</p>
<p>The problem with Nazis is that they are Nazis, and this is also the reason why we should not actively cultivate them, in science or elsewhere.</p>

  <title>New preprint: tmfast fits topic models fast</title>
  <dc:creator>Dan Hicks</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dhicks.github.io/posts/2023-05-04-tmfast.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Yesterday I published a new preprint on the arXiv: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01535">“<code>tmfast</code> fits topic models fast”</a>. Here’s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><code>tmfast</code> is an R package for fitting topic models using a fast algorithm based on partial PCA and the varimax rotation. After providing mathematical background to the method, we present two examples, using a simulated corpus and aggregated works of a selection of authors from the long nineteenth century, and compare the quality of the fitted models to a standard topic modeling package.</p>

<p>I started working on this two or three weeks ago, got about 1500 words in, and then had to shelve it to deal with a minor deluge of grading and some other things. I thought I would be able to pick it back up, but I’ve lost the thread. In the “writer’s notebook” spirit of this project, I’m just going to post it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In our Facebook discussion of <a href="2023-04-07-pluralism-problems">my last post</a>, Matt Brown referred to me a more recent paper of his on Feyerabend <span class="citation" data-cites="BrownExpertiseLessonFeyerabend2021">(Brown 2021)</span>. I really like this paper, and want to focus on it instead of the older one.</p>
<p>Brown discusses Feyerabend’s critique of expertise from “How to Defend Society against Science” <span class="citation" data-cites="FeyerabendHowDefendSociety1975">(Feyerabend 1975)</span> and <em>Science in a Free Society</em> [<span class="citation" data-cites="FeyerabendScienceFreeSociety2017">Feyerabend (2017)</span>; originally published 1978 . After tying Feyerabend’s critique to the current literature on science, values, and policy, and noting that Feyerabend had some overly simplistic political philosophy in the ’70s (which don’t really impact the argument Brown is interested in), Brown summarizes the critique of expertise as a sequence of “four increasingly radical claims about science and its place in society that, together, point toward a decentering of experts in society and a rejection of expert authority” (195).</p>
<p>In this post, I want to read these four claims together with <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span>, a fantastic study of the data analysis practices of Covid-19 skeptics. If you haven’t read this paper before, I can’t recommend it enough. <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> challenge the widespread (among natural scientists and public health official) deficit model of public scientific controversies, which blames controversies on public ignorance. Examining social media communications from 2020, <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> show that “anti-mask groups on Twitter often create polished counter-visualizations that would not be out of place in scientific papers, health department reports, and publications like the Financial Times” and that “these groups leverage the language of scientific rigor—being critical about data sources, explicitly stating analytical limitations of specific models, and more—in order to support ending public health restrictions despite the consensus of the scientific establishment” <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">(Lee et al. 2021, 1–2)</span>. I think this is a useful test case for distinguishing my own views from those of both Feyerabend and Brown.</p>
<section id="citizens-can-and-should-evaluate-expert-opinion" class="level1">
<h1>Citizens can and should evaluate expert opinion</h1>
<p>Brown discusses three arguments that Feyerabend gives for this first claim. I agree with this claim, and find the second and third argument most compelling.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The second argument is that public<sup>2</sup> evaluation of expert opinion will “contribute to … the development of a mature democratic citizenry” and that “the learning and maturation necessary for citizens to become wise or skillful public participants requires … that they be allowed to try and, perhaps, do poorly” (196). I actually don’t have much to say about this here; I’m noting it because I think it fits well with the broader project on experts as epistemic representatives, where part of the good of representation is actually promoting the democratic capacities of the constituency.</p>
<p>The third argument is that “motivated ‘laymen,’ in fact, can be competent enough to make good decisions regarding scientific information: ‘science is not beyond the natural shrewdness of the human race’” (196, quoting Feyerabend). This is something I emphasize with my students: that members of the general public are capable of getting together, educating themselves (collectively — this will be important later), and developing incisive technical critiques of credentialed expertise. My standard examples are ACT-UP <span class="citation" data-cites="EpsteinImpureScience1996">(Epstein 1996)</span> and environmental justice movements <span class="citation" data-cites="OttingerTechnoscienceEnvironmentalJustice2011">(Ottinger and Cohen 2011)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> find that members of the Covid-19 skeptic movement “provide[d] numerous tutorials on how to access government health data” and construct visualizations and perform analyses in ways that “encourage[d] … [social media] followers to begin their own data analysis projects” (11).</p>
</section>
<section id="citizens-can-and-should-supervise-science" class="level1">
<h1>Citizens can and should supervise science</h1>
<p>I don’t like the word “supervise” here; Brown discusses an important ambiguity in this term later (201). Brown gives a more precise gloss on the second claim, albeit in a way that won’t work as a section header: “According to Feyerabend, we should elect committees of non-experts to regularly subject scientists and their work to review before it is put to social use” (197).</p>
<p>The primary argument for this second claim comes from a view that Feyerabend shares with Kuhn and Lakatos, that “science contains some necessarily presumptive, dogmatic element that both makes scientific progress possible” but that also obstructs what Feyerabend calls “unchained curiosity” (198). As philosophers of science understand this thought today, scientific practice requires background assumptions, conceptual frameworks, and methodological standards that are often arbitrary, unjustified, left implicit, and/or known to be false. This epistemic infrastructure is all but necessary even to pose research questions and design data collection plans, and so well-functioning scientific communities have norms and enforcement mechanisms (often implicit) that compel their members to accept it. But there is a risk of mismatch, between the epistemic infrastructure developed by a group of experts to address the concerns they find interesting, and the practical needs of policymakers and publics. Feyerabend emphasizes the role of iconoclasts and outsiders in challenging the adequacy of the epistemic infrastructure of the scientific establishment.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> provide an example of this with</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>an ongoing animated debate within these groups about which metrics matter. Some users contend that deaths, not cases, should be the ultimate arbiter in policy decisions, since case rates are easily “manipulated” (e.g., with increased testing) and do not necessarily signal severe health problems (people can be asymptomatic). (11)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">One might argue that case rates are an appropriate metric for the health care system, insofar as a rise in case rates is a leading indicator of a rise of hospital admissions a week or two into the future. This assumes that some significant fraction of cases will be sufficiently severe to lead to hospital admissions. But Covid-19 skeptics are skeptical of exactly this fraction. In their eyes, the central question is whether Covid-19 is as severe as the scientific establishment claims. Since death is an unambiguous measure of severity, arguably death rates are a better metric for what they see as the central question. So here we might be able to see a mismatch between the epistemic infrastructure of the experts and that of (the Covid-19 skeptical section of) the public.</div>
<p>In <a href="2023-04-07-pluralism-problems">my last post</a> I made some points about reliability vs.&nbsp;relevance. Even if the methods used by the scientific community are highly reliable (truth-apt, for some non-pragmatic correspondence conception of truth), they’re not necessarily relevant to the epistemic and practical needs of the broader public(s). <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> also have a few examples of Covid-19 skeptics challenging the reliability of the scientific establishment. They quote one skeptic:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You can’t simply subtract the current death tally from the typical value for this time of year and attribute the difference to Covid,” a user wrote. “Because of the actions of our governments, we are actually causing excess deaths. Want to kill an old person quickly? Take away their human interaction and contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">This skeptic is arguing that <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/10/01/walk-the-walk/">simple calculations of excess deaths due to the pandemic</a> cannot distinguish deaths due to Covid-19 and deaths due to Covid-19 mitigation policies, and thus these methods are not reliable for estimating deaths due to Covid-19. I suspect almost all public health officials already understood this problem. But I would agree with Feyerabend that it’s appropriate for members of the public to ask public health officials whether and how they’ve taken this confounding into account.</div>
</section>
<section id="science-is-just-another-ideology-or-interest-group" class="level1">
<h1>Science Is Just Another Ideology or Interest Group</h1>
<p>This is where I start to diverge from Feyerabend and the Covid-19 skeptics. <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> argue that Covid-19 skeptics “seek to identify bias by being critical about specific profit motives that come from releasing (or suppressing) specific kinds of information,” (12) especially the interests of the pharmaceutical industry (12) and state authorities (11). That is, they see public health officials and the mainstream scientific community as corrupted, pursuing power and wealth rather than truth and health. But this is not a rejection of science as such: Covid-19 skeptics “use ‘data-driven’ narratives to justify their heterodox beliefs” (10), creating data visualizations, appealing to mainstream epistemic values such as data validation, data quality, and the need for control groups, and touting their own formal scientific credentials (10-12). As <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> put it, “their approach to the pandemic is grounded in a more scientific rigor, not less,”</p>
<p>Brown’s discussion of Feyerabend’s view is biographical:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Feyerabend taught at the University of California, Berkeley during the desegregation of public education in the United States and the attendant increase in non-white enrollments at Berkeley …. He came to see his educational role as essentially oppressive, pushing “reflections of the conceit of a small group who had succeeded in enslaving everyone else with their ideas,” and to find the very idea revolting …. The problem was that the ideology of the privileged remained centered. (199)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">And in <a href="2023-04-07-pluralism-problems">my last post</a> I wrote</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In other words, the “we” who find ourselves in a problematic situation can often be diverse in ways that lead “us” to different ways of understanding the nature of the problem. Giving “science” priority or greater standing over other considerations amounts to giving one group or perspective priority over the others.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">I even cited “How to Defend Society against Science” here. So why do I say that I diverge from Feyerabend and the Covid-19 skeptics here?</div>
<p>Feminist scientists and HPSTSers have long held a nuanced attitude towards science, which I some gloss as “<em>exactly</em> one and a half cheers for science.”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In exposing widespread, largely unremarked androcentric and sexist bias, feminists demonstrate that good science, even our best science, can be deeply structured by the values and interests of its makers …. Feminists engage the sciences not only as critics of bias and partiality but also as practitioners who recognize that systematic empirical inquiry has an indispensable role to play in understanding and changing oppressive conditions …. [T]he goal of understanding and changing conditions of life that disadvantage women requires as much empirical accuracy and explanatory precision as scientific inquiry can afford. <span class="citation" data-cites="WylieComingTermsValues2007">(Wylie and Hankinson Nelson 2007, 59)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">On the one hand, science has often been (and continues to be) a powerful tool of oppression, wielded against women and other oppressed groups. On the other hand, science can also be a powerful tool of justice, especially when those same groups find ways to turn the methods of scientific inquiry back on themselves, systematically studying systems of oppression and the role that science has played in them. (This — presented in Deweyan terms — is how I proposed to avoid anything-goes relativism in the previous post.)</div>
<p>Feyerabend was evidently sensitive to the first point here. But it seems to me that he missed the second point, falling into an irremediable cynicism about science and its role(s) in society.</p>
</section>
<section id="science-should-be-separated-from-the-state" class="level1">
<h1>Science Should Be Separated from the State</h1>
<p>Building off the previous point, Feyerabend’s argument here is an analogy with religion. Science, like religion, is just another interest group or ideology; respecting the fact of reasonable pluralism, liberal democracies formally separate religion and state power; and therefore liberal democracies should formally separate science and state power. Science should have no special standing or influence in policymaking, but also should be protected from excessive state interference.</p>
<p>At this point Brown revisits the notion of “supervise” from the second claim, that the public should supervise science. If “supervise” is interpreted as regulatory oversight and the exercise of state authority, then there’s a tension between the second claim and the idea that science, like religion, is a private activity and as such the state shouldn’t interfere with it. But if “supervise” is interpreted as “elect[ing] committees of non-experts to regularly subject scientists and their work to review <em>before it is put to social use</em>” (197, my emphasis) then there’s no tension. The public supervises the moment at which scientific findings are communicated to policymakers as advice. Scientists can do whatever they want on their side of the science-policy wall; it’s passage through the wall that’s subject to formal scrutiny and review.</p>
<p>This picture becomes much more complicated when the scientists in question are government employees, such as public health officials managing the collection, transmission, and publication of pandemic data. But perhaps Feyerabend’s view is that government employees shouldn’t be doing this kind of work. Managing public health is no more the state’s business than managing spiritual health. In this way, Feyerabend’s epistemic anarchism would seem to lead to political anarchism.</p>
<hr>
<p>I teach <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> in a data science course open to any graduate student in quantitative social science. A couple of years ago, one of the students noted that Covid-19 skeptics have an “individualistic epistemology.” As <span class="citation" data-cites="LeeViralVisualizationsHow2021">Lee et al. (2021)</span> put it, “anti-maskers value unmediated access to information and privilege personal research and direct reading over ‘expert’ interpretations.” I would suggest that this reflects an ideal from (right-) libertarian political philosophy, of self-reliance and independence (non-dependence) on others.</p>
<p>But this ideal is incompatible with the way the community of Covid-19 skeptics actually operates. Community members teach each other how to find and work with data, reinforce perceptions of state and scientific corruption, develop shared interpretations of their custom visualizations, and promote counterexperts (credentialed or not) with favorable views.</p>

<p>Matt Brown has some commentary <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hicks.daniel.j/posts/pfbid0Z31gfZEy2EgeYCGyBdD3XXfLVUQHJXW2gjjE1jwFQWQmuWQSCmRTtMon6PRDx4Q8l?comment_id=1392646594824355&amp;notif_id=1680900361004955&amp;notif_t=feed_comment&amp;ref=notif">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I’ve been invited to give <a href="https://values.utdallas.edu/2022/12/20/2023-conference/">a keynote</a> on Matt Brown’s work at the UT Dallas conference in May. <span class="citation" data-cites="BrownDemocraticControlScientific2013">Brown (2013)</span> fits with my current project (as seen in the recent blog posts), so this post is maybe the first of a sub-series of posts on his paper. All headless citations are to <span class="citation" data-cites="BrownDemocraticControlScientific2013">Brown (2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Brown first argues that there is a tension between the autonomy (lack of accountability) of science and its social and political authority in a democratic society. He quotes Douglas:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[A]n autonomous and authoritative science is intolerable …. A fully autonomous and authoritative science is too powerful, with no attendant responsibility <span class="citation" data-cites="DouglasSciencePolicyValuefree2009">(Douglas 2009, 7–8, as quoted by Brown, 481)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scholars and activists who have been sensitive to this tension — he names Feyerabend and STS scholars; we could include many feminists, anti-racists, and Marxists — “have tended to challenge the … authority of science …. weakening or denying the existence of expertise in politics” (481). This is objectionable because it amounts to “giv[ing] up tools in policy-making that we cannot do without, … given the remarkable success of science” (481-2).</p>
<p>Here, and elsewhere in the paper, Brown links the epistemic credibility or <em>reliability</em> of science to its political authority. Science should have authority in policymaking because it is an especially (the most?) reliable way of producing knowledge. But the kind or degree of political authority that Brown has in mind is vague. It’s one thing to say that scientific findings or methods can be useful in many policymaking situations, and so typically there should be a deliberate effort to solicit advice from scientists; it’s another to say that science should have some kind of priority or greater standing over other considerations.</p>
<p>I argue that Brown’s own account of inquiry should lead us towards the former formulation, of science as frequently useful rather than science taking priority. On Brown’s account, inquiry (scientific or otherwise) is a systematic response to a <em>problematic situation</em>, a situation in which we (we’ll come back to this “we”) realize that our established habits fail to realize their aims. Inquiry is considered <em>successful</em> insofar as it establishes a better fit between habits and aims; this might involve developing completely new habits, tweaking old habits, and/or reconstituting the aims.</p>
<p>A number of different kinds of controversies can emerge from this simple framework. In <strong>aim controversies</strong>, parties disagree over the aims that our habits are supposed to be realizing. <strong>Diagnostic controversies</strong> concern the explanation for why the habits are failing to realize their aims. We can even have <strong>problem controversies</strong>, in which parties disagree over whether we are in a problematic situation at all. Brown gives the example of US policy debates surrounding health care reform in 2009-2010 (483-4), which featured each of these kinds of controversies.</p>
<p>When parties disagree with each other in these kinds of ways, they will disagree with each other about whether a line of inquiry should be considered <strong>relevant</strong> to a policy problem, and thus whether it should be counted as successful with respect to the problematic situation at hand. For example, consider an economic analysis that finds that a combination of employer and individual health insurance mandates and a means-tested subsidy for private insurance will tend to increase health insurance coverage. This line of inquiry might be considered successful by someone whose diagnosis of the problem with the US health care system is that private insurance is too expensive, but not by people who think the problem is a profit-driven healthcare industry or creeping government overreach. For the latter two groups of people, even if the economic analysis is highly reliable it is not relevant to developing a solution to the problem <span class="citation" data-cites="CartwrightEvidenceBasedPolicyPractical2012 HicksEpistemologicalDepthGM2015">(Cartwright and Hardie 2012; Hicks 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, the “we” who find ourselves in a problematic situation can often be diverse in ways that lead “us” to different ways of understanding the nature of the problem. Giving “science” priority or greater standing over other considerations amounts to giving one group or perspective priority over the others <span class="citation" data-cites="FeyerabendHowDefendSociety1975 LonginoCanThereBe1987 LaceyScientificResearchTechnological2014 HicksGeneticallyModifiedCrops2017">(Feyerabend 1975; Longino 1987; Lacey 2014; Hicks 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>This analysis might seem to threaten to degenerate into anything-goes relativism, with partisans cherry-picking the science that fits their preferred account of the problem <span class="citation" data-cites="SarewitzHowScienceMakes2004">(Sarewitz 2004)</span>. But I think we can avoid relativism by viewing a policy controversy as itself a problematic situation prompting inquiry. In other words, we can use scientific inquiry as a way to understand and thereby navigate political conflict, not as a cudgel that one side gets to use against the others.</p>
<p>Consider climate change. Climate scientists have raised concerns in public about the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions for over 35 years, but policy responses have been faltering at best and public attitudes seem deeply divided. Why is this, and what could be done to get a better match between the apparent problem and a policy solution? Scholars in several fields of the social sciences and humanities have tackled this question for at least 20 years, working to understand the roles of fossil fuel companies <span class="citation" data-cites="OreskesMerchantsDoubtHow2011 SupranAssessingExxonMobilClimate2017">(Oreskes and Conway 2011; Supran and Oreskes 2017)</span>; uncertainties in climate science, both real and manufactured <span class="citation" data-cites="LloydModelRobustnessConfirmatory2015">(Lloyd 2015)</span>; public perceptions of and attitudes towards climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="LewandowskyAliceWonderlandMechanics2016 LeiserowitzGlobalWarmingSix2021">(Lewandowsky, Cook, and Lloyd 2016; Leiserowitz et al. 2021)</span>; and how well political representatives understand the views and preferences of their constituents <span class="citation" data-cites="BolsenCitizensScientistsPolicy2015 Hertel-FernandezLegislativeStaffRepresentation2019">(Bolsen, Druckman, and Cook 2015; Hertel-Fernandez, Mildenberger, and Stokes 2019)</span>. Taken together, this body of work supports a model on which there is strong public support for climate policy, even among Republican/conservative voters, but that the fossil fuel industry’s propaganda efforts have succeeded in creating the misleading appearance of scientific and public controversy, what <span class="citation" data-cites="SparkmanAmericansExperienceFalse2022">Sparkman, Geiger, and Weber (2022)</span> call a “false social reality: a near universal perception of public opinion that is the opposite of true public sentiment.”</p>
<p>Much like using physical climate models to model future flood risks <span class="citation" data-cites="ParkerIncorporatingUserValues2019 LuskPoliticalLegitimacyDemocratic2020">(Parker and Lusk 2019; Lusk 2020)</span>, this body of social scientific-humanistic climate research is useful without claiming priority over other concerns. By understanding key actors and constituencies in the climate controversy, policymakers can design policies that are more likely to gather the support of broad coalitions. For example, a distinct feature of Ocasio-Cortez and Markey’s 2019 Green New Deal resolution was its call for a “just transition,” enabling fossil fuel workers to gradually move into other industries or take early retirement. These ideas played a significant role in the 2021 American Jobs Plan <span class="citation" data-cites="SicotteWillGreenNew2021">(Sicotte 2021)</span>, and thereby influenced the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill.</p>
