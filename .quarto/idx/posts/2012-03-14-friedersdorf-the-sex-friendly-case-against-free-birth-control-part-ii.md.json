This suggests that the right approach to pregnancy -- at least, with respect to medicine -- is one that attempts to balance the benefits of medicalization with respect for women's sexuality and reproductive justice.  \n\nPerhaps this can be done in terms of Friedersdorf's account of medicine:  the medicalization of pregnancy is, when not invasive or oppressive, preventative medicine. But then birth control is *also* preventative medicine.  Like both abstinence and regular checkups with an OB/GYN, *birth control is a very reliable way to avoid pre-eclampsia. *So, like regular checkups with an OB/GYN -- for both pregnant and 'potentially pregnant' women -- birth control seems to be good preventative medicine, and the subsidy seems justified.  \n\nNote that I am *not* arguing here that birth control is good preventative medicine for ovarian cysts or painful menstruation.  I think it's good preventative medicine for those things as well.  But those arguments don't support subsidizing birth control *as birth control*.  They support subsidizing it under some other description.  Here I'm arguing that birth control is good preventative medicine *for all of the life-threatening complications surrounding pregnancy*.  \n\nFriedersdorf might be trying to pre-empt this argument when he points out that '\\[t\\]he condition being prevented, pregnancy, can be avoided through an alternative approach, abstinence, that is completely effective and free'.  Maybe I don't understand the argument he's gesturing out -- it's not actually spelled out any more than this, I think -- but it strikes me as utterly uncompelling.  In general, for a given end E, there are indefinitely many courses of action (means) M1, M2, M3, ..., that can reliable realize E.  Some of these courses of action will be better in all respects than others.  But, I claim, there will still be indefinitely many courses of action such that, for any two M1 and M2, M1 is better in some respects than M2 and M2 is better in some respects than M1.  For example:  \n\n-   Abstinence is effective when it comes to voluntary intercourse; it is absolutely free; has no health side-effects; but for most people it is extraordinarily difficult to do consistently; and it is useless when it comes to rape.  \n-   Natural family planning is difficult to do well, which makes it stress-inducing in its own particular ways; is more-or-less free (one has to pay for the thermometers and calendars); has no health side-effects; but is not terribly reliable; and is also useless when it comes to rape.  \n-   Condoms are inexpensive; but slightly to modestly diminish the pleasure of intercourse for most people; can break; and are also useless when it comes to rape.  \n-   Regular birth control is as effective as any of the others, and indeed is the only one of these not useless when it comes to rape; but it requires taking a pill at the same time every day; can have some negative health side-effects; and does cost more than condoms.  \n\nAll four of these options have something to say in their favor, but none is clearly superior to all of the others.  This argument is like saying that, from South Bend, one can get to Chicago by plane, train, or automobile:  not a good reason to not subsidize one of the options.  \n\n::: {#footer}\n[ March 14th, 2012 1:04pm ]{#timestamp} [gender/sex]{.tag}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"2012-03-14-friedersdorf-the-sex-friendly-case-against-free-birth-control-part-ii.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"author":"Dan Hicks","layout":"post","title":"Friedersdorf: The Sex-Friendly Case Against Free Birth Control, part II","date":"2012-03-14","categories":["birth","medicine","preventative"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
