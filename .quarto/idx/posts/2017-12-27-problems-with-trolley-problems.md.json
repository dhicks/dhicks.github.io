This model might itself fit within, and so reinforce, a broader isolationist model of engineering practice.\n\nInfeasible\n----------\n\n-   Trolley problem scenarios are non-monotonic: adding additional details can change the valence of the consequences\n-   The space of trolley problem scenarios is non-surveyable. Designers cannot feasibly survey all (or even a large, \"realistic\" subset) of these problems in order to develop ex ante guidelines for autonomous vehicles' behavior.\n\n-   Can autonomous cars reliably determine the number of pedestrians they might hit? Which ones are children? etc. Put positively, what information does an autonomous car actually have about its environment?\n\n-   Do autonomous cars deliberate like human beings? In line with either utilitarian or deontological models of practical reasoning?\n\n::: {#footer}\n[ December 27th, 2017 1:56pm ]{#timestamp}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"2017-12-27-problems-with-trolley-problems.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"author":"Dan Hicks","layout":"post","title":"Problems with Trolley Problems","date":"2017-12-27","categories":["reasoning"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
