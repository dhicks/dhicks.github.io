    Success and impact metrics in science are based on a system that perpetuates
    sexist and racist “rewards” by prioritizing citations and impact factors.
    These metrics are flawed and biased against already marginalized groups and
    fail to accurately capture the breadth of individuals’ meaningful scientific
    impacts. We advocate shifting this outdated value system to advance science
    through principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We outline
    pathways for a paradigm shift in scientific values based on multidimensional
    mentorship and promoting mentee well-being. These actions will require
    collective efforts supported by academic leaders and administrators to drive
    essential systemic change.

    This article outlines a network approach to the study of technological
    change. We propose that new inventions reshape networks of interlinked
    technologies by shifting inventors’ attention to or away from the knowledge
    on which those inventions build. Using this approach, we develop novel
    indexes of the extent to which a new invention consolidates or destabilizes
    existing technology streams. We apply these indexes in analyses of
    university research commercialization and find that, although federal
    research funding pushes campuses to create inventions that are more
    destabilizing, deeper commercial ties lead them to produce technologies that
    consolidate the status quo. By quantifying the effects that new technologies
    have on their predecessors, the indexes we propose allow patent-based
    studies of innovation to capture conceptually important phenomena that are
    not detectable with established measures. The measurement approach presented
    here offers empirical insights that support theoretical development in
    studies of innovation, entrepreneurship, technology strategy, science
    policy, and social network theory.This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming,
    entrepreneurship and innovation.

    We investigated the association between a U.S. National Institutes of Health
    (NIH) R01 applicant’s self-identified race or ethnicity and the probability
    of receiving an award by using data from the NIH IMPAC II grant database,
    the Thomson Reuters Web of Science, and other sources. Although proposals
    with strong priority scores were equally likely to be funded regardless of
    race, we find that Asians are 4 percentage points and black or
    African-American applicants are 13 percentage points less likely to receive
    NIH investigator-initiated research funding compared with whites. After
    controlling for the applicant’s educational background, country of origin,
    training, previous research awards, publication record, and employer
    characteristics, we find that black applicants remain 10 percentage points
    less likely than whites to be awarded NIH research funding. Our results
    suggest some leverage points for policy intervention.

    NIH research project grants from 2000 to 2006 show evidence of racial/ethnic
    disparities in the probability of receiving an award.

  abstract: >-
    Universality of scaled citation distributions was claimed a decade ago but
    its theoretical justification has been lacking so far. Here, we study
    citation distributions for three disciplines—Physics, Economics, and
    Mathematics—and assess them using our explanatory model of citation
    dynamics. The model posits that the citation count of a paper is determined
    by its fitness: the attribute, which, for most papers, is set at the moment
    of publication. In addition, the papers’ citation count is related to the
    process by which the knowledge about this paper propagates in the scientific
    community. Our measurements indicate that the fitness distribution for
    different disciplines is nearly identical and can be approximated by the
    log-normal distribution, while the viral propagation process is discipline
    specific. The model explains which sets of citation distributions can be
    scaled and which cannot. In particular, we show that the near-universal
    shape of the citation distributions for different disciplines and for
    different citation years traces its origin to the nearly universal fitness
    distribution, while deviations from this shape are associated with the
    discipline-specific citation dynamics of papers.

    Abstract
                Female authors are underrepresented in top economics journals. In this paper, I investigate whether higher writing standards contribute to the problem. I find: (i) female-authored papers are 1–6 percent better written than equivalent papers by men; (ii) the gap widens during peer review; (iii) women improve their writing as they publish more papers (but men do not); (iv) female-authored papers take longer under review. Using a subjective expected utility framework, I argue that higher writing standards for women are consistent with these stylised facts. A counterfactual analysis suggests senior female economists may, as a result, write at least five percent more clearly than they otherwise would. As a final exercise, I show tentative evidence that women adapt to biased treatment in ways that may disguise it as voluntary choice.

  abstract: >-
    Novel scientiﬁc knowledge is constantly produced by the scientiﬁc community.
    Understanding the level of novelty characterized by scientiﬁc literature is
    key for modeling scientiﬁc dynamics and analyzing the growth mechanisms of
    scientiﬁc knowledge. Metrics derived from bibliometrics and citation
    analysis were effectively used to characterize the novelty in scientiﬁc
    development. However, time is required before we can observe links between
    documents such as citation links or patterns derived from the links, which
    makes these techniques more effective for retrospective analysis than
    predictive analysis. In this study, we present a new approach to measuring
    the novelty of a research topic in a scientiﬁc community over a speciﬁc
    period by tracking semantic changes of the terms and characterizing the
    research topic in their usage context. The semantic changes are derived from
    the text data of scientiﬁc literature by temporal embedding learning
    techniques. We validated the effects of the proposed novelty metric on
    predicting the future growth of scientiﬁc publications and investigated the
    relations between novelty and growth by panel data analysis applied in a
    large-scale publication dataset (MEDLINE/PubMed). Key ﬁndings based on the
    statistical investigation indicate that the novelty metric has signiﬁcant
    predictive effects on the growth of scientiﬁc literature and the predictive
    effects may last for more than ten years. We demonstrated the effectiveness
    and practical implications of the novelty metric in three case studies.

    This paper introduces a bibliometric, citation network-based method for
    assessing the social validation of novel research, and applies this method
    to the development of high-throughput toxicology research at the US
    Environmental Protection Agency. Social validation refers to the acceptance
    of novel research methods by a relevant scientific community; it is formally
    independent of the technical validation of methods, and is frequently
    studied in history, philosophy, and social studies of science using
    qualitative methods. The quantitative methods introduced here find that
    high-throughput toxicology methods are spread throughout a large and
    well-connected research community, which suggests high social validation.
    Further assessment of social validation involving mixed qualitative and
    quantitative methods are discussed in the conclusion.

  abstract: >-
    There is widespread interest in evaluating the social impacts of research
    and other scholarly activities. Conventional metrics for social impacts
    focus on economics or wealth creation, such as patents or technology
    transfer. These kinds of metrics are less appropriate for many scholarly
    fields, and miss the specific social concerns or needs that researchers aim
    to address. In this paper, drawing on ideas from ethics and development
    economics, we develop a conceptual framework for characterizing the social
    goals of research. We first distinguish resources — such as wealth and
    intellectual credit — from the goals of scholarship, and further distinguish
    inward- and outward-facing goals. Outward-facing goals refer to the intended
    social impacts of research. Next we introduce the Capabilities Approach, a
    conceptual framework for human well-being developed by ethicists and
    economists over the last 40 years. This Approach focuses on basic human
    needs, rather than wealth, and we draw specifically on a list of central
    human capabilities developed by philosopher Martha Nussbaum. We propose that
    the items on this list provide a useful starting point for articulating the
    specific social aims of research. We argue that the Capabilities Approach
    can facilitate research communication and improve the recognition of public
    engagement in academic and funding institutions. Familiar bibliographic data
    and text mining methods can be used in a capabilities-inspired portfolio
    analysis, and modest changes to existing data collection systems — for
    tenure and promotion, or research funding applications — could support the
    development of even richer capabilities-inspired metrics and incentive
    systems.

    The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), together with other federal
    agencies, launched the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) program in 2011.
    The aim of the NRI is to accelerate the development and use of collaborative
    robots (corobots), which work beside or cooperatively with people. To date,
    the NRI program has involved multiple directorates of the NSF (Computer and
    Information Science and Engineering; Engineering; Social, Behavioral, and
    Economic Sciences; and Education and Human Resources) and several other
    federal research funding agencies [the U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE), NASA, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)]. As the
    program prepared to announce its sixth round of awards in the summer of
    2017, we took the opportunity to reflect on the impacts of the first five
    years of NRI funding.

    In 2004, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation launched a new program focused on
    incubating a new field, “Microbiology of the Built Environment” (MoBE). By
    the end of 2017, the program had supported the publication of hundreds of
    scholarly works, but it was unclear to what extent it had stimulated the
    development of a new research community. We identified 307 works funded by
    the MoBE program, as well as a comparison set of 698 authors who published
    in the same journals during the same period of time but were not part of the
    Sloan Foundation-funded collaboration. Our analysis of collaboration
    networks for both groups of authors suggests that the Sloan Foundation’s
    program resulted in a more consolidated community of researchers,
    specifically in terms of number of components, diameter, density, and
    transitivity of the coauthor networks. In addition to highlighting the
    success of this particular program, our method could be applied to other
    fields to examine the impact of funding programs and other large-scale
    initiatives on the formation of research communities.

    Organized Research Units (ORUs) are nondepartmental units utilized by U.S.
    research universities to support interdisciplinary research initiatives,
    among other goals. This study examined the impacts of ORUs at one large
    public research university, the University of California, Davis (UC Davis),
    using a large corpus of journal article metadata and abstracts for both
    faculty affiliated with UCD ORUs and a comparison set of other faculty.
    Using regression analysis, I find that ORUs appeared to increase the number
    of coauthors of affiliated faculty, but did not appear to directly affect
    publication or citation counts. Next, I frame interdisciplinarity in terms
    of a notion of discursive space, and use a topic model approach to situate
    researchers within this discursive space. The evidence generally indicates
    that ORUs promoted multidisciplinarity rather than interdisciplinarity. In
    the conclusion, drawing on work in philosophy of science on inter- and
    multidisciplinarity, I argue that multidisciplinarity is not necessarily
    inferior to interdisciplinarity.

    The safety argument is perhaps the most widely cited argument in favor of
    the rapid development and widespread adoption of automated vehicles (AVs).
    Versions of this argument promote the development and use of AVs on the
    grounds that these vehicles will have much lower crash, injury, or fatality
    rates than human drivers. (Throughout this essay, I assume that AVs are
    designed to respond to malfunctions and hazards without human intervention,
    corresponding to level 4 or 5 automation [1].) For example, the U.S.

    Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet
    underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful
    careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well?
    We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US
    doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into
    publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning
    to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations?
    Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations?
    And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our
    analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of
    scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and
    discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities
    are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by
    gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender
    and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific
    careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be
    unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that
    discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the
    underrepresentation of some groups in academia.

    Citations are widely considered in scientists' evaluation. As such,
    scientists may be incentivized to inflate their citation counts. While
    previous literature has examined self-citations and citation cartels, it
    remains unclear whether scientists can purchase citations. Here, we compile
    a dataset of ~1.6 million profiles on Google Scholar to examine instances of
    citation fraud on the platform. We survey faculty at highly-ranked
    universities, and confirm that Google Scholar is widely used when evaluating
    scientists. Intrigued by a citation-boosting service that we unravelled
    during our investigation, we contacted the service while undercover as a
    fictional author, and managed to purchase 50 citations. These findings
    provide conclusive evidence that citations can be bought in bulk, and
    highlight the need to look beyond citation counts.

  abstract: >-
    How can decisionmakers charged with protecting the environment and the
    public's health and safety steer clear of false and misleading scientific
    research? Is it possible to give scientists a stronger voice in regulatory
    processes without yielding too much control over policy, and how can this be
    harmonized with democratic values? These are just some of the many
    controversial and timely questions that Sheila Jasanoff asks in this study
    of the way science advisers shape federal policy. In their expanding role as
    advisers, scientists have emerged as a formidable fifth branch of
    government. But even though the growing dependence of regulatory agencies on
    scientific and technical information has granted scientists a greater
    influence on public policy, opinions differ as to how those contributions
    should be balanced against other policy concerns. More important, who should
    define what counts as good science when all scientific claims incorporate
    social factors and are subject to negotiation? Jasanoff begins by describing
    some significant failures--such as nitrites, Love Canal, and alar--in
    administrative and judicial decisionmaking that fed the demand for more peer
    review of regulatory science. In analyzing the nature of scientific claims
    and methods used in policy decisions, she draws comparisons with the
    promises and limitations of peer review in scientific organizations
    operating outside the regulatory context. The discussion of advisory
    mechanisms draws on the author's close scrutiny of two highly visible
    federal agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
    Administration. Here we see the experts in action as they deliberate on
    critical issues such as clean air, pesticide regulation, and the safety of
    pharmaceuticals and food additives. Jasanoff deftly merges legal and
    institutional analysis with social studies of science and presents a strong
    case for procedural reforms. In so doing, she articulates a
    social-construction model that is intended to buttress the effectiveness of
    the fifth branch.

  abstract: >-
    The ever-increasing competitiveness in the academic publishing market
    incentivizes journal editors to pursue higher impact factors. This
    translates into journals becoming more selective, and, ultimately, into
    higher publication standards. However, the fixation on higher impact factors
    leads some journals to artificially boost impact factors through the
    coordinated effort of a “citation cartel” of journals. “Citation cartel”
    behavior has become increasingly common in recent years, with several
    instances being reported. Here, we propose an algorithm—named CIDRE—to
    detect anomalous groups of journals that exchange citations at excessively
    high rates when compared against a null model that accounts for scientific
    communities and journal size. CIDRE detects more than half of the journals
    suspended from Journal Citation Reports due to anomalous citation behavior
    in the year of suspension or in advance. Furthermore, CIDRE detects many new
    anomalous groups, where the impact factors of the member journals are lifted
    substantially higher by the citations from other member journals. We
    describe a number of such examples in detail and discuss the implications of
    our findings with regard to the current academic climate.

  abstract: >-
    Scholars belong to multiple communities of credit simultaneously. When these
    communities disagree about a scholarly achievement’s credit assignment, this
    raises a puzzle for decision and game theoretic models of credit seeking in
    science. The reference class problem for credit valuation in science is the
    problem of determining to which of an agent’s communities—which reference
    class—credit determinations should be indexed for an act under some state of
    nature. Solving this problem requires developing rich, mutually informed
    theories of community and credit that are sensitive to the structure and
    status systems of complex, heterogeneous scholarly networks.

  abstract: >-
    Controversial understandings of the coronavirus pandemic have turned data
    visualizations into a battleground. Defying public health officials,
    coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data
    visualizations showing that the government's pandemic response was excessive
    and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic
    visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who
    mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of
    data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical
    policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread
    on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about
    COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro-
    and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar
    data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations
    reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in
    public life.

  abstract: >-
    Academics and companies increasingly draw on large datasets to understand
    the social world, and name-based demographic ascription tools are widespread
    for imputing information that is often missing from these large datasets.
    These approaches have drawn criticism on ethical, empirical and theoretical
    grounds. Using a survey of all authors listed on articles in sociology,
    economics and communication journals in Web of Science between 2015 and
    2020, we compared self-identified demographics with name-based imputations
    of gender and race/ethnicity for 19,924 scholars across four gender
    ascription tools and four race/ethnicity ascription tools. We found
    substantial inequalities in how these tools misgender and misrecognize the
    race/ethnicity of authors, distributing erroneous ascriptions unevenly among
    other demographic traits. Because of the empirical and ethical consequences
    of these errors, scholars need to be cautious with the use of demographic
    imputation. We recommend five principles for the responsible use of
    name-based demographic inference. Algorithmic gender and race/ethnicity
    inference tools based on author names have very high error rates in
    marginalized communities. This may result in misleading results in many
    computational social science and sociology projects.

  abstract: >-
    This study explores the extent to which bibliometric indicators based on
    counts of highly-cited documents could be affected by the choice of data
    source. The initial hypothesis is that databases that rely on journal
    selection criteria for their document coverage may not necessarily provide
    an accurate representation of highly-cited documents across all subject
    areas, while inclusive databases, which give each document the chance to
    stand on its own merits, might be better suited to identify highly-cited
    documents. To test this hypothesis, an analysis of 2515 highly-cited
    documents published in 2006 that Google Scholar displays in its Classic
    Papers product is carried out at the level of broad subject categories,
    checking whether these documents are also covered in Web of Science and
    Scopus, and whether the citation counts offered by the different sources are
    similar. The results show that a large fraction of highly-cited documents in
    the Social Sciences and Humanities (8.6–28.2%) are invisible to Web of
    Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and Health Sciences the proportion
    of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and Scopus is much
    lower. Furthermore, in all areas, Spearman correlation coefficients of
    citation counts in Google Scholar, as compared to Web of Science and Scopus
    citation counts, are remarkably strong (.83–.99). The main conclusion is
    that the data about highly-cited documents available in the inclusive
    database Google Scholar does indeed reveal significant coverage deficiencies
    in Web of Science and Scopus in several areas of research. Therefore, using
    these selective databases to compute bibliometric indicators based on counts
    of highly-cited documents might produce biased assessments in poorly covered
    areas.

    Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and
    Scopus being widely consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research
    evaluations, there is no recent or systematic evidence about the differences
    between them. In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to
    2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories
    published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS
    consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas
    (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly
    all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by
    GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books,
    conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English
    (19%38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that
    were also in Scopus or WoS. Despite the many unique GS citing sources,
    Spearman correlations between citation counts in GS and WoS or Scopus are
    high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between GS and
    WoS than between GS and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas GS
    citation data is essentially a superset of WoS and Scopus, with substantial
    extra coverage.

  abstract: >-
    It is well known in bibliometrics that the average number of citations per
    paper differs greatly between the various disciplines. The differing
    citation culture (in particular the different average number of references
    per paper and thereby the different probability of being cited) is widely
    seen as the cause of this variation. Based on all Web of Science (WoS)
    records published in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 we demonstrate that
    almost all disciplines show similar numbers of references in the appendices
    of their papers. Our results suggest that the average citation rate is far
    more influenced by the extent to which the papers (cited as references) are
    included in WoS as linked database records. For example, the comparatively
    low citation rates in the humanities are not at all the result of a lower
    average number of references per paper but are caused by the low fraction of
    linked references which refer to papers published in the core journals
    covered by WoS.

  abstract: >-
    Underrepresented minority (URM) faculty face challenges in many domains of
    academia, from university admissions to grant applications. We examine
    whether this translates to promotion and tenure (P&T) decisions. Data from
    five US universities on 1,571 faculty members’ P&T decisions show that URM
    faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive
    unanimous votes from P&T committees. A double standard in how scholarly
    productivity is rewarded is also observed, with below-average h-indexes
    being judged more harshly for URM faculty than for non-URM faculty. This
    relationship is amplified for faculty with intersectional backgrounds,
    especially URM women. The differential treatment of URM women was mitigated
    when external reviewers highlighted candidates’ scholarship more in their
    review letters. In sum, the results support the double standard hypothesis
    and provide evidence that different outcomes in P&T decision-making
    processes contribute to the sustained underrepresentation of URM faculty in
    tenured faculty positions.

  abstract: >-
    We study the distributions of citations received by a single publication
    within several disciplines, spanning broad areas of science. We show that
    the probability that an article is cited c times has large variations
    between different disciplines, but all distributions are rescaled on a
    universal curve when the relative indicator cf = c/c0 is considered, where
    c0 is the average number of citations per article for the discipline. In
    addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation
    distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different
    years, are compared. These findings provide a strong validation of cf as an
    unbiased indicator for citation performance across disciplines and years.
    Based on this indicator, we introduce a generalization of the h index
    suitable for comparing scientists working in different fields.

    Google Scholar (GS) is a free tool that may be used by researchers to
    analyze citations; find appropriate literature; or evaluate the quality of
    an author or a contender for tenure, promotion, a faculty position, funding,
    or research grants. GS has become a major bibliographic and citation
    database. For assessing the literature, databases, such as PubMed, PsycINFO,
    Scopus, and Web of Science, can be used in place of GS because they are more
    reliable. The aim of this study was to examine the accuracy of citation data
    collected from GS and provide a comprehensive description of the errors and
    miscounts identified. For this purpose, 281 documents that cited 2 specific
    works were retrieved via Publish or Perish software (PoP) and were examined.
    This work studied the false-positive issue inherent in the analysis of
    neuroimaging data. The results revealed an unprecedented error rate, with
    279 of 281 (99.3%) examined references containing at least one error.
    Nonacademic documents tended to contain more errors than academic
    publications (U=5117.0; P&lt;.001). This viewpoint article, based on a case
    study examining GS data accuracy, shows that GS data not only fail to be
    accurate but also potentially expose researchers, who would use these data
    without verification, to substantial biases in their analyses and results.
    Further work must be conducted to assess the consequences of using GS data
    extracted by PoP.

  abstract: >-
    The first large-scale empirical analysis of the gender gap in science,
    showing how the structure of scientific labor and rewards—publications,
    citations, funding—systematically obstructs women’s career advancement.If
    current trends continue, women and men will be equally represented in the
    field of biology in 2069. In physics, math, and engineering, women should
    not expect to reach parity for more than a century. The gender gap in
    science and technology is narrowing, but at a decidedly unimpressive pace.
    And even if parity is achievable, what about equity?Equity for Women in
    Science, the first large-scale empirical analysis of the global gender gap
    in science, provides strong evidence that the structures of scientific
    production and reward impede women’s career advancement. To make their case,
    Cassidy R. Sugimoto and Vincent Larivière have conducted scientometric
    analyses using millions of published papers across disciplines. The data
    show that women are systematically denied the chief currencies of scientific
    credit: publications and citations. The rising tide of collaboration only
    exacerbates disparities, with women unlikely to land coveted leadership
    positions or gain access to global networks. The findings are unequivocal:
    when published, men are positioned as key contributors and women are
    relegated to low-visibility technical roles. The intersecting disparities in
    labor, reward, and resources contribute to cumulative disadvantages for the
    advancement of women in science.Alongside their eye-opening analyses,
    Sugimoto and Larivière offer solutions. The data themselves point the way,
    showing where existing institutions fall short. A fair and equitable
    research ecosystem is possible, but the scientific community must first
    disrupt its own pervasive patterns of gatekeeping.
