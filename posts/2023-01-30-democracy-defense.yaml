    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

    The argument from inductive risk (AIR) is perhaps the most common argument
    against the value-free ideal of science. Brian MacGillivray rejects the AIR
    (at least as it would apply to risk assessment) and embraces the value-free
    ideal. We clarify the issues at stake and argue that MacGillivray's
    criticisms, although effective against some formulations of the AIR, fail to
    overcome the essential concerns that motivate the AIR. There are inevitable
    trade-offs in scientific enquiry that cannot be resolved with any formal
    methods or general rules. Choices must be made, and values will be involved.
    It is best to recognize this explicitly. Even so, there is more work to be
    done developing methods and institutional support for these choices.

    Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields
    (“the replication crisis”) have stimulated a movement for open science,
    encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and
    analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency
    (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule
    prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices
    are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this
    paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of
    environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science
    requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical
    evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health
    specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the
    replication crisis extends to environmental public health — or not — seem
    premature. By distinguishing three concepts — reproducibility,
    replicability, and robustness — it is clear that open data initiatives can
    promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote
    replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open
    science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the
    costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.

    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

    Philosophers now commonly reject the value free ideal for science by arguing
    that non-epistemic values, including personal or social values, are
    permissible within the core of scientific research. However, little
    attention has been paid to the normative political consequences of this
    position. This paper explores these consequences and shows how political
    theory is fruitful for proceeding in a world without value-neutral science.
    I draw attention to an oft-overlooked argument employed by proponents of the
    value free ideal I dub the “political legitimacy argument.” This argument
    claims that the value-free ideal follows directly from the foundational
    principles of liberal democracy. If so, then the use of value-laden
    scientific information within democratic decision making would be
    illegitimate on purely political grounds. Despite highlighting this
    unaddressed and important argument, I show how it can be rejected. By
    appealing to deliberative democratic theory, I demonstrate scientific
    information can be value-laden and politically legitimate. The deliberative
    democratic account I develop is well suited for capturing the intuitions of
    many opponents of the value free ideal and points to a new set of questions
    for those interested in values in science.
