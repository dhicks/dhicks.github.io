Yesterday I published a new preprint on the arXiv: ["`tmfast` fits topic models fast"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01535).  Here's the abstract: 

> `tmfast` is an R package for fitting topic models using a fast algorithm based on partial PCA and the varimax rotation. After providing mathematical background to the method, we present two examples, using a simulated corpus and aggregated works of a selection of authors from the long nineteenth century, and compare the quality of the fitted models to a standard topic modeling package. 

The package itself is available [on Github](https://github.com/dhicks/tmfast).
