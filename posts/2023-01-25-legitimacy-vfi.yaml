  abstract: >-
    Science is the most reliable means available for understanding the world
    around us and our place in it. But, since science draws conclusions based on
    limited empirical evidence, there is always a chance that a scientific
    inference will be incorrect. That chance, known as inductive risk, is
    endemic to science. Though inductive risk has always been present in
    scientific practice, the role of values in responding to it has only
    recently gained extensive attention from philosophers, scientists, and
    policy-makers. Exploring Inductive Risk brings together a set of eleven
    concrete case studies with the goals of illustrating the pervasiveness of
    inductive risk, assisting scientists and policymakers in responding to it,
    and moving theoretical discussions of this phenomenon forward. The case
    studies range over a wide variety of scientific contexts, including the drug
    approval process, high energy particle physics, dual-use research, climate
    science, research on gender disparities in employment, clinical trials, and
    toxicology. The book includes an introductory chapter that provides a
    conceptual introduction to the topic and a historical overview of the
    argument that values have an important role to play in responding to
    inductive risk, as well as a concluding chapter that synthesizes important
    themes from the book and maps out issues in need of further consideration.

  abstract: >-
    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

    "People of good will wish to see science and religion at peace. . . . I do
    not see how science and religion could be unified, or even synthesized,
    under any common scheme of explanation or analysis; but I also do not
    understand why the two enterprises should experience any conflict." So
    states internationally renowned evolutionist and bestselling author Stephen
    Jay Gould in the simple yet profound thesis of his brilliant new
    book.Writing with bracing intelligence and elegant clarity, Gould sheds new
    light on a dilemma that has plagued thinking people since the Renaissance.
    Instead of choosing between science and religion, Gould asks, why not opt
    for a golden mean that accords dignity and distinction to each realm?At the
    heart of Gould's penetrating argument is a lucid, contemporary principle he
    calls NOMA (for nonoverlapping magisteria)--a "blessedly simple and entirely
    conventional resolution" that allows science and religion to coexist
    peacefully in a position of respectful noninterference. Science defines the
    natural world; religion, our moral world, in recognition of their separate
    spheres of influence.In elaborating and exploring this thought-provoking
    concept, Gould delves into the history of science, sketching affecting
    portraits of scientists and moral leaders wrestling with matters of faith
    and reason. Stories of seminal figures such as Galileo, Darwin, and Thomas
    Henry Huxley make vivid his argument that individuals and cultures must
    cultivate both a life of the spirit and a life of rational inquiry in order
    to experience the fullness of being human.In his bestselling books Wonderful
    Life, The Mismeasure of Man, and Questioning the Millennium, Gould has
    written on the abundance of marvels in human history and the natural world.
    In Rocks of Ages, Gould's passionate humanism, ethical discernment, and
    erudition are fused to create a dazzling gem of contemporary cultural
    philosophy. As the world's preeminent Darwinian theorist writes, "I believe,
    with all my heart, in a respectful, even loving concordat between . . .
    science and religion."

  abstract: >-
    There is now a general consensus amongst philosophers in the values in
    science literature that values necessarily play a role in core areas of
    scientific inquiry. We argue that attention should now be turned from
    debating the value-free ideal to delineating legitimate from illegitimate
    influences of values in science, a project we dub “The New Demarcation
    Problem.” First, we review past attempts to demarcate the uses of values and
    propose a categorization of the strategies by where they seek to draw
    legitimacy from. Next, we propose a set of desiderata for what we take to be
    a satisfactory solution and present a case study where conflicting sets of
    values clearly impinge on science, but where the legitimacy of their
    influence is ambiguous. We use these desiderata and the case study to
    illustrate what we take to be the strengths and weaknesses of current
    strategies. To be clear, our goal is not to answer the question we pose, but
    to articulate a framework within which a solution can be judged.

  abstract: >-
    "Epidemiology is often referred to as the science of public health. However,
    unlike other major sciences, its theoretical foundations are rarely
    articulated. While the idea of epidemiologic theory may seem dry and arcane,
    it is at its core about explaining the people's health. It is about life and
    death. It is about biology and society. It is about ecology and the economy.
    It is about how myriad aspects of people's lives--involving work, dignity,
    desire, love, play, conflict, discrimination, and injustice--become
    literally incorporated biologically into our bodies and manifest in our
    health status, individually and collectively. And it is about essential
    knowledge critical for improving the people's health and minimizing
    inequitable burdens of disease, disability, and death. Woven from a vast
    array of schools of thought, including those in the natural, social, and
    biomedical sciences, epidemiologic theory is a rich tapestry whose time for
    analysis is long overdue. By tracing its history and contours from ancient
    societies on through the development of--and debates within--contemporary
    epidemiology worldwide, Nancy Krieger shows how epidemiologic theory has
    long shaped epidemiologic practice, knowledge, and the politics of public
    health. Outlining an ecosocial theory of disease distribution that situates
    both population health and epidemiologic theory in societal and ecologic
    context, she offers a more holistic picture of how we embody the human
    experience"--Provided by publisher

  abstract: >-
    Since the late nineteenth century, the "cost of living" has been a prominent
    part of debates about American political economy. By the early twentieth
    century, that prominence had taken a quantitative turn, as businessmen,
    unions, economists, and politicians all turned to cost-of-living statistics
    in their struggle to control and reshape the American economy. Today, the
    continuing power of these statistics is exemplified by the U.S Consumer
    Price Index, whose fluctuations have enormous consequences for economic
    policy and the federal budget (including the allocation of hundreds of
    billions of dollars annually through cost-of-living escalator clauses in
    programs such as Social Security). In this book, Stapleford interweaves
    economic theory with political history to create a novel account of the
    quantitative knowledge that underpins much of American political economy.
    Demonstrating that statistical calculations inevitably require political
    judgments, he reveals what choices were made in constructing and using
    cost-of-living statistics and why those choices matter both for our
    understanding of American history and for contemporary political and
    economic life.
