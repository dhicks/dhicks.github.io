I gave a talk at the Center for Dewey Studies in Carbondale on April 4.  Slides are [here](https://epistemic-rep.netlify.app/), the recording is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tKTnaKNt0Y), and the abstract is below. 

> For decades, traditional notions of objectivity and ideals of politically neutral, "value-free" science have been challenged by the history, philosophy, and social studies of science.  For most scholars in these fields, science is unavoidably "shot through with values," and value-laden decisions appear throughout the "nooks and crannies" of everyday scientific research.  But some have pushed back, arguing that accepting value-ladenness would allow scientists to undemocratically impose their values on everyone else.  This is the "democracy defense" of value-free science.  
> 
> One line of response to the democracy defense appeals to ideas of deliberative democracy, imagining increased public participation in science-based policymaking.  But deliberative democratic approaches have difficulty reaching into the "nooks and crannies" of scientific research itself, where it would be impractical for scientists to consult with the public.  
> 
> In this talk, I consider whether the theory of political representation might be useful for thinking about when and how the judgment of a select few can democratically represent the general public.  In other words, can we think of scientists as epistemic representatives, more or less the way politicians serve as political representatives?  I suggest that recent work in political theory, on informal representation and systems of democratic representation, are promising for such an approach.
