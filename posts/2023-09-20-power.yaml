  abstract: >-
    The idea that science is or should be value-free, and that values are or
    should be formed independently of science, has been under fire by
    philosophers of science for decades. Science and Moral Imagination directly
    challenges the idea that science and values cannot and should not influence
    each other. Matthew J. Brown argues that science and values mutually
    influence and implicate one another, that the influence of values on science
    is pervasive and must be responsibly managed, and that science can and
    should have an influence on our values. This interplay, he explains, must be
    guided by accounts of scientific inquiry and value judgment that are
    sensitive to the complexities of their interactions. Brown presents
    scientific inquiry and value judgment as types of problem-solving practices
    and provides a new framework for thinking about how we might ethically
    evaluate episodes and decisions in science, while offering guidance for
    scientific practitioners and institutions about how they can incorporate
    value judgments into their work. His framework, dubbed "the ideal of moral
    imagination," emphasizes the role of imagination in value judgment and the
    positive role that value judgment plays in science.

  abstract: >-
    The public controversy over genetically modified (GM) crops is predominantly
    framed in terms of health and safety risks to humans and the environment.
    However, opponents of GM crops are motivated by a wide variety of other
    social, political, and economic concerns. In this paper, I critically assess
    the predominance of the health and safety framing in terms of Iris Young’s
    model of communicative democracy. I argue that the health and safety framing
    leads to the marginalization of the social, political, and economic concerns
    of GM opponents, within both public discourse and government, and is
    therefore democratically illegitimate.

    restrictionsIntroductionThe controversy over genetically modified [GM]
    organisms is often framed in terms of possible hazards for human health.
    Entries in a previous volume of this encyclopedia give a general overview of
    GM crops (Mulvaney 2014) and specifically examine human health (Nordgard et
    al. 2014) and label (Bruton 2014) issues surrounding GM organisms. This
    entry explores several other aspects of the controversy: environmental
    concerns, political and legal disputes, and the aim of “feeding the world”
    and promoting food security. Rather than discussing abstract, hypothetical
    GM organisms, this entry explores the consequences of the GM organisms that
    have actually been deployed in the particular contexts that they have been
    deployed, on the belief that there is li ...

  abstract: >-
    How can decisionmakers charged with protecting the environment and the
    public's health and safety steer clear of false and misleading scientific
    research? Is it possible to give scientists a stronger voice in regulatory
    processes without yielding too much control over policy, and how can this be
    harmonized with democratic values? These are just some of the many
    controversial and timely questions that Sheila Jasanoff asks in this study
    of the way science advisers shape federal policy. In their expanding role as
    advisers, scientists have emerged as a formidable fifth branch of
    government. But even though the growing dependence of regulatory agencies on
    scientific and technical information has granted scientists a greater
    influence on public policy, opinions differ as to how those contributions
    should be balanced against other policy concerns. More important, who should
    define what counts as good science when all scientific claims incorporate
    social factors and are subject to negotiation? Jasanoff begins by describing
    some significant failures--such as nitrites, Love Canal, and alar--in
    administrative and judicial decisionmaking that fed the demand for more peer
    review of regulatory science. In analyzing the nature of scientific claims
    and methods used in policy decisions, she draws comparisons with the
    promises and limitations of peer review in scientific organizations
    operating outside the regulatory context. The discussion of advisory
    mechanisms draws on the author's close scrutiny of two highly visible
    federal agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
    Administration. Here we see the experts in action as they deliberate on
    critical issues such as clean air, pesticide regulation, and the safety of
    pharmaceuticals and food additives. Jasanoff deftly merges legal and
    institutional analysis with social studies of science and presents a strong
    case for procedural reforms. In so doing, she articulates a
    social-construction model that is intended to buttress the effectiveness of
    the fifth branch.

    Steven Lukes' Power: A Radical View is a seminal work still widely used some
    30 years after publication. The second edition includes the complete
    original text alongside two major new essays. One assesses the main debates
    about how to conceptualize and study power, including the influential
    contributions of Michel Foucault. The other reconsiders Steven Lukes' own
    views in light of these debates and of criticisms of his original argument.
    With a new introduction and bibliographical essay, this book will
    consolidate its reputation as a classic work and a major reference point
    within social and political theory.

  abstract: "In 2005, beekeepers in the United States began observing a mysterious and disturbing phenomenon: once-healthy colonies of bees were suddenly collapsing, leaving behind empty hives full of honey and pollen. Over the following decade, widespread honeybee deaths—some of which have come to be called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)—have continued to bedevil beekeepers and threaten the agricultural industries that rely on bees for pollination. Scientists continue to debate the causes of CCD, yet there is no clear consensus on how to best solve the problem.\_\_Vanishing Bees takes us inside the debates over widespread honeybee deaths, introducing the various groups with a stake in solving the mystery of CCD, including beekeepers, entomologists, growers, agrichemical companies, and government regulators. Drawing from extensive interviews and first-hand observations, Sainath Suryanarayanan and Daniel Lee Kleinman examine how members of each group have acquired, disseminated, and evaluated knowledge about CCD. In addition, they explore the often-contentious interactions among different groups, detailing how they assert authority, gain trust, and build alliances.\_As it explores the contours of the CCD crisis, Vanishing Bees considers an equally urgent question: what happens when farmers, scientists, beekeepers, corporations, and federal agencies approach the problem from different vantage points and cannot see eye-to-eye? The answer may have profound consequences for every person who wants to keep fresh food on the table."
