    We explore the common attributes of political conflicts in which scientific
    findings have a central role, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study,
    but also drawing on long-standing conflicts over climate change and
    vaccinations. We analyze situations in which the systematic spread of
    disinformation or conspiracy theories undermines public trust in the work of
    scientists and prevents policy from being informed by the best available
    evidence. We also examine instances in which public opposition to
    scientifically grounded policy arises from legitimate value judgments and
    lived experience. We argue for the public benefit of quick identification of
    politically motivated science denial, and inoculation of the public against
    its ill effects.
