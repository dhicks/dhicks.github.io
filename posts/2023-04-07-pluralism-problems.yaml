    Numerous factors shape citizens’ beliefs about global warming, but there is
    very little research that compares the views of the public with key actors
    in the policymaking process. We analyze data from simultaneous and parallel
    surveys of (1) the U.S. public, (2) scientists who actively publish research
    on energy technologies in the United States, and (3) congressional policy
    advisors and find that beliefs about global warming vary markedly among
    them. Scientists and policy advisors are more likely than the public to
    express a belief in the existence and anthropogenic nature of global
    warming. We also find ideological polarization about global warming in all
    three groups, although scientists are less polarized than the public and
    policy advisors over whether global warming is actually occurring.
    Alarmingly, there is evidence that the ideological divide about global
    warming gets significantly larger according to respondents’ knowledge about
    politics, energy, and science.

  abstract: >-
    Over the last twenty or so years, it has become standard to require policy
    makers to base their recommendations on evidence. That is now
    uncontroversial to the point of triviality—of course, policy should be based
    on the facts. But are the methods that policy makers rely on to gather and
    analyze evidence the right ones? In Evidence-Based Policy, Nancy Cartwright,
    an eminent scholar, and Jeremy Hardie, who has had a long and successful
    career in both business and the economy, explain that the dominant methods
    which are in use now—broadly speaking, methods that imitate standard
    practices in medicine like randomized control trials—do not work. They fail,
    Cartwright and Hardie contend, because they do not enhance our ability to
    predict if policies will be effective. The prevailing methods fall short not
    just because social science, which operates within the domain of real-world
    politics and deals with people, differs so much from the natural science
    milieu of the lab. Rather, there are principled reasons why the advice for
    crafting and implementing policy now on offer will lead to bad results.
    Current guides in use tend to rank scientific methods according to the
    degree of trustworthiness of the evidence they produce. That is valuable in
    certain respects, but such approaches offer little advice about how to think
    about putting such evidence to use. Evidence-Based Policy focuses on showing
    policymakers how to effectively use evidence. It also explains what types of
    information are most necessary for making reliable policy, and offers
    lessons on how to organize that information.

  abstract: |-
    Legislative staff link Members of Congress and their constituents,
    theoretically facilitating democratic representation. Yet, little
    research has examined whether Congressional staff actually recognize
    the preferences of their Members’ constituents. Using an original
    survey of senior US Congressional staffers, we show that staff
    systematically mis-estimate constituent opinions. We then evaluate
    the sources of these misperceptions, using observational analyses
    and two survey experiments. Staffers who rely more heavily on
    conservative and business interest groups for policy information
    have more skewed perceptions of constituent opinion. Egocentric
    biases also shape staff perceptions. Our findings complicate
    assumptions that Congress represents constituent opinion, and help
    to explain why Congress often appears so unresponsive to ordinary
    citizens. We conclude that scholars should focus more closely on
    legislative aides as key actors in the policymaking process, both in
    the United States and across other advanced democracies.

  abstract: >-
    This paper examines the scientific controversy over the yields of
    genetically modified [GM] crops as a case study in epistemologically deep
    disagreements. Appeals to “the evidence” are inadequate to resolve such
    disagreements; not because the interlocutors have radically different
    metaphysical views (as in cases of incommensurability), but instead because
    they assume rival epistemological frameworks and so have incompatible views
    about what kinds of research methods and claims count as evidence.
    Specifically, I show that, in the yield debate, proponents and opponents of
    GM crops cite two different sets of claims as evidence, which correspond to
    two rival epistemological frameworks, classical experimental epistemology
    and Nancy Cartwright's evidence for use. I go on to argue that, even if both
    sides of the debate accepted Cartwright's view, they might still disagree
    over what counts as evidence, because evidence for use ties standards of
    evidence to what is sometimes called the “context of application.”

  abstract: >-
    The public controversy over genetically modified (GM) crops is predominantly
    framed in terms of health and safety risks to humans and the environment.
    However, opponents of GM crops are motivated by a wide variety of other
    social, political, and economic concerns. In this paper, I critically assess
    the predominance of the health and safety framing in terms of Iris Young’s
    model of communicative democracy. I argue that the health and safety framing
    leads to the marginalization of the social, political, and economic concerns
    of GM opponents, within both public discourse and government, and is
    therefore democratically illegitimate.

  abstract: >-
    Strategic communication requires the identification and understanding of
    target audiences for tailored communication. The Global Warming’s Six
    Americas analysis segments the U.S. public into six distinct, but internally
    consistent audiences, who each respond differently to the issue of climate
    change. The segments include the Alarmed, Concerned, Cautious, Disengaged,
    Doubtful, and Dismissive. The framework was first developed in 2008 and has
    been tracked twice a year using nationally representative surveys for over a
    decade. This research has helped advance communication theory and practice
    and the Six Americas framework has informed the decision making of
    stakeholders ranging from scientists to government officials, journalists,
    educators, and advocates. The framework has also been extended to assess
    specialized audiences (e.g. broadcast meteorologists) and other countries
    (e.g. India, Australia, and Germany). Future research should further develop
    and investigate the Six Americas within the United States, while also
    developing tailored segmentations and related tools for other countries.

  abstract: >-
    Science strives for coherence. For example, the findings from climate
    science form a highly coherent body of knowledge that is supported by many
    independent lines of evidence: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human
    economic activities are causing the global climate to warm and unless GHG
    emissions are drastically reduced in the near future, the risks from climate
    change will continue to grow and major adverse consequences will become
    unavoidable. People who oppose this scientific body of knowledge because the
    implications of cutting GHG emissions—such as regulation or increased
    taxation—threaten their worldview or livelihood cannot provide an
    alternative view that is coherent by the standards of conventional
    scientific thinking. Instead, we suggest that people who reject the fact
    that the Earth’s climate is changing due to greenhouse gas emissions (or any
    other body of well-established scientific knowledge) oppose whatever
    inconvenient finding they are confronting in piece-meal fashion, rather than
    systematically, and without considering the implications of this rejection
    to the rest of the relevant scientific theory and findings. Hence, claims
    that the globe “is cooling” can coexist with claims that the “observed
    warming is natural” and that “the human influence does not matter because
    warming is good for us.” Coherence between these mutually contradictory
    opinions can only be achieved at a highly abstract level, namely that
    “something must be wrong” with the scientific evidence in order to justify a
    political position against climate change mitigation. This high-level
    coherence accompanied by contradictory subordinate propositions is a known
    attribute of conspiracist ideation, and conspiracism may be implicated when
    people reject well-established scientific propositions.

  abstract: >-
    I propose a distinct type of robustness, which I suggest can support a
    confirmatory role in scientific reasoning, contrary to the usual
    philosophical claims. In model robustness, repeated production of the
    empirically successful model prediction or retrodiction against a background
    of independently-supported and varying model constructions, within a group
    of models containing a shared causal factor, may suggest how confident we
    can be in the causal factor and predictions/retrodictions, especially once
    supported by a variety of evidence framework. I present climate models of
    greenhouse gas global warming of the 20th Century as an example, and
    emphasize climate scientists' discussions of robust models and causal
    aspects. The account is intended as applicable to a broad array of sciences
    that use complex modeling techniques.

    The U.S. scientific community has long led the world in research on such
    areas as public health, environmental science, and issues affecting quality
    of life. These scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of
    DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a
    small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial
    of these dangers.Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit
    group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep
    connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the
    public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades.
    Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures
    who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied
    the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid
    rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole. "Doubt is our product," wrote one tobacco
    executive. These "experts" supplied it. Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway,
    historians of science, roll back the rug on this dark corner of the American
    scientific community, showing how ideology and corporate interests, aided by
    a too-compliant media, have skewed public understanding of some of the most
    pressing issues of our era.

  abstract: >-
    Increasingly there are calls for climate services to be “co-produced” with
    users, taking into account not only the basic information needs of users but
    also their value systems and decision contexts. What does this mean in
    practice? One way that user values can be incorporated into climate services
    is in the management of inductive risk. This involves understanding which
    errors in climate service products would have particularly negative
    consequences from the users’ perspective (e.g., underestimating rather than
    overestimating the change in an impact variable) and then prioritizing the
    avoidance of those errors. This essay shows how inductive risk could be
    managed in climate services in ways that serve user values and argues that
    there are both ethical and practical reasons in favor of doing so.

    Pluralistic ignorance—a shared misperception of how others think or
    behave—poses a challenge to collective action on problems like climate
    change. Using a representative sample of Americans (N = 6119), we examine
    whether Americans accurately perceive national concern about climate change
    and support for mitigating policies. We find a form of pluralistic ignorance
    that we describe as a false social reality: a near universal perception of
    public opinion that is the opposite of true public sentiment. Specifically,
    80–90% of Americans underestimate the prevalence of support for major
    climate change mitigation policies and climate concern. While 66–80%
    Americans support these policies, Americans estimate the prevalence to only
    be between 37–43% on average. Thus, supporters of climate policies outnumber
    opponents two to one, while Americans falsely perceive nearly the opposite
    to be true. Further, Americans in every state and every assessed demographic
    underestimate support across all polices tested. Preliminary evidence
    suggests three sources of these misperceptions: (i) consistent with a false
    consensus effect, respondents who support these policies less
    (conservatives) underestimate support by a greater degree; controlling for
    one’s own personal politics, (ii) exposure to more conservative local norms
    and (iii) consuming conservative news correspond to greater misperceptions.

    This paper assesses whether ExxonMobil Corporation has in the past misled
    the general public about climate change. We present an empirical
    document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate
    change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and
    non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid,
    editorial-style advertisements (‘advertorials’) in The New York Times . We
    examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the
    state of climate science and its implications—specifically, we compare their
    positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In
    all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible,
    they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced
    between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for
    expressions of reasonable doubt, 83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of
    internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused,
    yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt. We
    conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science—by way of
    its scientists’ academic publications—but promoted doubt about it in
    advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the
    public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil’s discussion of the
    risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and
    sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from
    advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline
    ExxonMobil’s strategic approach to climate change research and
    communication, which helps to contextualize our findings.
