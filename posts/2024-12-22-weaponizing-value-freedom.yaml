  abstract: >-
    Although the American Psychological Association has taken a strong
    antiracism stance, scientific racism continues to be published in psychology
    journals and scholarly books. Recent articles claim that the folk categories
    of race are genetically meaningful divisions and that evolved genetic
    differences among races and nations are important for explaining immutable
    differences in cognitive ability, educational attainment, crime, sexual
    behavior, and wealth; all claims that are opposed by a strong scientific
    consensus to the contrary. These claims remain a serious source of harm
    through the naturalization of inequality and through support for the work of
    racial extremists. Contemporary “racial hereditarian research” claims to
    rest on modern genetics and evolutionary biology and to draw on their
    methods, such as genome-wide association studies. These new arguments fail
    to meet the evidentiary and ethical standards of these disciplines for the
    study of human variation. If psychology adopted standards from genetics and
    evolutionary biology, the current racial hereditarian work would be
    ineligible for publication. Actions that the American Psychological
    Association can take to deal with scientific racism are described. (PsycInfo

  abstract: >-
    More than a decade of exacting scientific research involving paleontological
    fragments and ancient DNA has lately produced a series of pronouncements
    about a purportedly novel population of archaic hominins dubbed “the
    Denisova.” The science involved in these matters is both technically
    stunning and, socially, at times a bit reckless. Here I discuss the
    responsibilities which scientists incur when they make inductively risky
    pronouncements about the different relative contributions by Denisovans to
    genomes of members of apparent subpopulations of current humans (i.e., the
    so-called “races”). This science is sensational: it is science which
    empirically speculates, to the public delight’s and entertainment, about
    scintillating topics such as when humans evolved, where we came from, and
    who else we were having sex with during our early hominin history. An
    initial characterization of sensational science emerges from my discussion
    of the case, as well as a diagnosis of an interactive phenomenon termed
    amplified inductive risk.

  abstract: >-
    There is widespread interest in evaluating the social impacts of research
    and other scholarly activities. Conventional metrics for social impacts
    focus on economics or wealth creation, such as patents or technology
    transfer. These kinds of metrics are less appropriate for many scholarly
    fields, and miss the specific social concerns or needs that researchers aim
    to address. In this paper, drawing on ideas from ethics and development
    economics, we develop a conceptual framework for characterizing the social
    goals of research. We first distinguish resources — such as wealth and
    intellectual credit — from the goals of scholarship, and further distinguish
    inward- and outward-facing goals. Outward-facing goals refer to the intended
    social impacts of research. Next we introduce the Capabilities Approach, a
    conceptual framework for human well-being developed by ethicists and
    economists over the last 40 years. This Approach focuses on basic human
    needs, rather than wealth, and we draw specifically on a list of central
    human capabilities developed by philosopher Martha Nussbaum. We propose that
    the items on this list provide a useful starting point for articulating the
    specific social aims of research. We argue that the Capabilities Approach
    can facilitate research communication and improve the recognition of public
    engagement in academic and funding institutions. Familiar bibliographic data
    and text mining methods can be used in a capabilities-inspired portfolio
    analysis, and modest changes to existing data collection systems — for
    tenure and promotion, or research funding applications — could support the
    development of even richer capabilities-inspired metrics and incentive
    systems.

  abstract: >-
    Anthropologists and human geneticists have long rejected race science,
    research that can be utilized to purportedly justify racial inequality and
    colonialism.  But race science has persisted, at the very least on the
    margins of the mainstream scientific community.  In this study,
    scientometric and text mining methods were used to trace the appearance of
    race science discourse in both mainstream behavioral science journals and
    the parascholarly journal *Mankind Quarterly* from 1960 to 2010.  Our
    analysis found two distinguishable lines of race science discourse.  One is
    strongly associated with *Mankind Quarterly*, while the other — emphasizing
    race and intelligence — is more prevalent with mainstream psychology
    journals, especially *Intelligence* and *Personality and Individual
    Differences*.  We compare psychology's response to race science to those of
    other fields, and discuss the social responsibility of scientists with
    respect to race science.

    Imre Lakatos' philosophical and scientific papers are published here in two
    volumes. Volume I brings together his very influential but scattered papers
    on the philosophy of the physical sciences, and includes one important
    unpublished essay on the effect of Newton's scientific achievement. Volume
    II presents his work on the philosophy of mathematics (much of it
    unpublished), together with some critical essays on contemporary
    philosophers of science and some famous polemical writings on political and
    educational issues. Imre Lakatos had an influence out of all proportion to
    the length of his philosophical career. This collection exhibits and
    confirms the originality, range and the essential unity of his work. It
    demonstrates too the force and spirit he brought to every issue with which
    he engaged, from his most abstract mathematical work to his passionate
    'Letter to the director of the LSE'. Lakatos' ideas are now the focus of
    widespread and increasing interest, and these volumes should make possible
    for the first time their study as a whole and their proper assessment.

  abstract: >-
    The emphasis on the limitations of objectivity, in specific guises and
    networks, has been a continuing theme of contemporary analytic philosophy
    for the past few decades. The popular sport of baiting feminist philosophers
    -- into pointing to what's left out of objective knowledge, or into
    describing what methods, exactly, they would offer to replace the powerful
    "objective" methods grounding scientific knowledge -- embodies a blatant
    double standard which has the effect of constantly putting feminist
    epistemologists on the defensive, on the fringes, on the run. This strategy
    can only work if 'objectivity' is transparent, simple, stable, and clear in
    its meaning. It most certainly is not. In fact, taking 'objectivity' as a
    sort of beautiful primitive, self-evident in its value, and all-powerful in
    its revelatory power, requires careless philosophy, and the best workers in
    metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science have made reworked
    definitions of 'objectivity' absolutely central to their own projects. In
    fact, classic feminist concerns with exploring the impact of sex and gender
    on knowledge, understanding, and other relations between human beings and
    the rest of the world fall squarely within the sort of human and social
    settings that are already considered central in most current analytic
    metaphysics, episteomology, and philosophy of science. I argue that the
    burden of proof is clearly on those who wish to reject the centrality and
    relevance of sex and gender to our most fundamental philosophical work on
    knowledge and reality.

    Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science brings together original
    essays by both feminist and mainstream philosophers of science that examine
    issues at the intersections of feminism, science, and the philosophy of
    science. Contributors explore parallels and tensions between feminist
    approaches to science and other approaches in the philosophy of science and
    more general science studies. In so doing, they explore notions at the heart
    of the philosophy of science, including the nature of objectivity, truth,
    evidence, cognitive agency, scientific method, and the relationship between
    science and values.

  abstract: >-
    In this consensus report by a diverse group of academics who conduct and/or
    are concerned about social and behavioral genomics (SBG) research, the
    authors recount the often-ugly history of scientific attempts to understand
    the genetic contributions to human behaviors and social outcomes. They then
    describe what the current science—including genomewide association studies
    and polygenic indexes—can and cannot tell us, as well as its risks and
    potential benefits. They conclude with a discussion of responsible behavior
    in the context of SBG research. SBG research that compares individuals
    within a group according to a “sensitive” phenotype requires extra attention
    to responsible conduct and to responsible communication about the research
    and its findings. SBG research (1) on sensitive phenotypes that (2) compares
    two or more groups defined by (a) race, (b) ethnicity, or (c) genetic
    ancestry (where genetic ancestry could easily be misunderstood as race or
    ethnicity) requires a compelling justification to be conducted, funded, or
    published. All authors agree that this justification at least requires a
    convincing argument that a study's design could yield scientifically valid
    results; some authors would additionally require the study to have a
    socially favorable risk-benefit profile.

  abstract: >-
    This paper describes a three and a half year study conducted over the course
    of the Apollo lunar missions with forty-two of the most prestigious
    scientists who studied the lunar rocks. The paper supports the Merton-E.
    Barber concept of sociological ambivalence, that social institutions reflect
    potentially conflicting sets of norms. The paper offers a set of
    counter-norms for science, arguing that if the norm of universalism is
    rooted in the impersonal character of science, an opposing counter-norm is
    rooted in the personal character of science. The paper also argues that not
    only is sociological ambivalence a characteristic of science, but it seems
    necessary for the existence and ultimate rationality of science.
