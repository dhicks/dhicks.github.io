  abstract: >-
    Scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has long focused on both the use of
    expertise and public accountability. However, few have considered the degree
    to which public input affects the use of research in U.S. regulatory impact
    analyses (RIAs). We examine changes in the research that is cited in RIAs in
    response to public comments to assess the influence of participation on the
    use of information for rulemaking. We conduct an in-depth analysis of
    comments on a major proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule
    to determine whether regulators alter the evidence used based on public
    input and whether some types of commenters have more influence than others.
    We analyze the text similarity of comments to scientific research utilized
    in the RIAs to determine whether regulators iteratively update their rule
    justification based on scientific information referenced in comments. We
    find support for seminal subgovernment theories about the relationship
    between business interests, Congress, and the bureaucracy; in relation to
    all kinds of commenters, members of Congress and industry groups had the
    strongest effect on changes in the research used in the RIAs. The article
    provides one of the first statistical analyses of science exchange between
    the public and a bureaucratic agency.

  abstract: >-
    Science is the most reliable means available for understanding the world
    around us and our place in it. But, since science draws conclusions based on
    limited empirical evidence, there is always a chance that a scientific
    inference will be incorrect. That chance, known as inductive risk, is
    endemic to science. Though inductive risk has always been present in
    scientific practice, the role of values in responding to it has only
    recently gained extensive attention from philosophers, scientists, and
    policy-makers. Exploring Inductive Risk brings together a set of eleven
    concrete case studies with the goals of illustrating the pervasiveness of
    inductive risk, assisting scientists and policymakers in responding to it,
    and moving theoretical discussions of this phenomenon forward. The case
    studies range over a wide variety of scientific contexts, including the drug
    approval process, high energy particle physics, dual-use research, climate
    science, research on gender disparities in employment, clinical trials, and
    toxicology. The book includes an introductory chapter that provides a
    conceptual introduction to the topic and a historical overview of the
    argument that values have an important role to play in responding to
    inductive risk, as well as a concluding chapter that synthesizes important
    themes from the book and maps out issues in need of further consideration.

  abstract: >-
    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

  abstract: >-
    A ‘deliberative wave’, with increasing uses of deliberative citizen forums,
    is sweeping the globe. Whereas deliberative citizen forum enthusiasts claim
    that they represent appropriate tools to reconnect citizens with politics
    and demand a stronger empowerment of deliberative citizen forums, critics
    argue that they will reduce rather than increase democratic legitimacy. This
    letter sheds new light on the roles of deliberative citizen forums in
    democratic systems, with a particular eye on disaffected citizens. Drawing
    on a conjoint experiment with a representative sample of non-participating
    German citizens, it shows that citizens in general challenge notions of the
    strong empowerment of deliberative citizen forums. They prefer deliberative
    citizen forums that are limited to policy advice, collaborate with legacy
    institutions and include extra provisions (such as a large size or clear
    majorities). By contrast, disaffected citizens are more open to the
    empowerment and decoupling of deliberative citizen forums compared to
    allegiant citizens, but this not imply that they are generally in clear
    favour of such design features (in fact, they are mostly indifferent
    viaà-vis empowerment and decoupling). These findings have important
    ramifications for democratic designs.

    "People of good will wish to see science and religion at peace. . . . I do
    not see how science and religion could be unified, or even synthesized,
    under any common scheme of explanation or analysis; but I also do not
    understand why the two enterprises should experience any conflict." So
    states internationally renowned evolutionist and bestselling author Stephen
    Jay Gould in the simple yet profound thesis of his brilliant new
    book.Writing with bracing intelligence and elegant clarity, Gould sheds new
    light on a dilemma that has plagued thinking people since the Renaissance.
    Instead of choosing between science and religion, Gould asks, why not opt
    for a golden mean that accords dignity and distinction to each realm?At the
    heart of Gould's penetrating argument is a lucid, contemporary principle he
    calls NOMA (for nonoverlapping magisteria)--a "blessedly simple and entirely
    conventional resolution" that allows science and religion to coexist
    peacefully in a position of respectful noninterference. Science defines the
    natural world; religion, our moral world, in recognition of their separate
    spheres of influence.In elaborating and exploring this thought-provoking
    concept, Gould delves into the history of science, sketching affecting
    portraits of scientists and moral leaders wrestling with matters of faith
    and reason. Stories of seminal figures such as Galileo, Darwin, and Thomas
    Henry Huxley make vivid his argument that individuals and cultures must
    cultivate both a life of the spirit and a life of rational inquiry in order
    to experience the fullness of being human.In his bestselling books Wonderful
    Life, The Mismeasure of Man, and Questioning the Millennium, Gould has
    written on the abundance of marvels in human history and the natural world.
    In Rocks of Ages, Gould's passionate humanism, ethical discernment, and
    erudition are fused to create a dazzling gem of contemporary cultural
    philosophy. As the world's preeminent Darwinian theorist writes, "I believe,
    with all my heart, in a respectful, even loving concordat between . . .
    science and religion."

    All administrative processes contain points of entry for politics, and the
    U.S. president's use of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review
    government regulations is no exception. Specifically, OMB review can open up
    a pathway for interest groups to lobby for policy change. We theorize that
    interest group lobbying can be influential during OMB review, especially
    when there is consensus across groups. We use a selection model to test our
    argument with more than 1,500 regulations written by federal agencies that
    were subjected to OMB review. We find that lobbying is associated with
    change during OMB review. We also demonstrate that, when only business
    groups lobby, we are more likely to see rule change; however, the same is
    not true for public interest groups. We supplement these results with
    illustrative examples suggesting that interest groups can, at times, use OMB
    review to influence the content of legally binding government regulations.

    Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, people have been eager to learn what
    factors, and especially what public health policies, cause infection rates
    to wax and wane. But figuring out conclusively what causes what is difficult
    in complex systems with nonlinear dynamics, such as pandemics. We review
    some of the challenges that scientists have faced in answering quantitative
    causal questions during the Covid-19 pandemic, and suggest that these
    challenges are a reason to augment the moral dimension of conversations
    about causal inference. We take a lesson from Martha Nussbaum—who cautions
    us not to think we have just one question on our hands when we have at least
    two—and apply it to modeling for causal inference in the context of
    cost-benefit analysis.

    Scientific modelling is a value-laden process: the decisions involved can
    seldom be made using ‘scientific’ criteria alone, but rather draw on social
    and ethical values. In this paper, we draw on a body of philosophical
    literature to analyze a COVID-19 vaccination model, presenting a case study
    of social and ethical value judgments in health-oriented modelling. This
    case study urges us to make value judgments in health-oriented models
    explicit and interpretable by non-experts and to invite public involvement
    in making them.

  abstract: >-
    There is now a general consensus amongst philosophers in the values in
    science literature that values necessarily play a role in core areas of
    scientific inquiry. We argue that attention should now be turned from
    debating the value-free ideal to delineating legitimate from illegitimate
    influences of values in science, a project we dub “The New Demarcation
    Problem.” First, we review past attempts to demarcate the uses of values and
    propose a categorization of the strategies by where they seek to draw
    legitimacy from. Next, we propose a set of desiderata for what we take to be
    a satisfactory solution and present a case study where conflicting sets of
    values clearly impinge on science, but where the legitimacy of their
    influence is ambiguous. We use these desiderata and the case study to
    illustrate what we take to be the strengths and weaknesses of current
    strategies. To be clear, our goal is not to answer the question we pose, but
    to articulate a framework within which a solution can be judged.

    is higher than a process in which citizens are not able to participate at
    all, but no higher than a process that includes a participation method that
    relies on self-selection. Our findings imply that deliberative mini-publics
    may not be the right instrument to repair the loss of legitimacy that many
    democratic institutions are thought to suffer.

    Decades of social science scholarship have documented and explored the
    interconnected nature of science, technology, and society. Multiple
    theoretical frameworks suggest the potential to direct this process of
    mutual shaping toward desired outcomes and away from undesired ones through
    broader inclusion of new voices and visions. In 2010, a group of
    researchers, educators, and policy practitioners established the Expert and
    Citizen Assessment of Science and Technology (ECAST) network to
    operationalize these frameworks. Over the course of a decade, ECAST
    developed an innovative and reflexive participatory technology assessment
    (pTA) method to support democratic science policy decision-making in
    different technical, social, and political contexts. The method's reflexive
    nature gave rise to continuous innovations and iterative improvements. The
    current ECAST pTA method includes three participatory phases: 1) Problem
    Framing; 2) ECAST Citizen Deliberation; and 3) Results and Integration.
    Proving adaptable and replicable, the method has generated outputs for
    decision-making on a variety of science and technology issues and at
    governance scales ranging from the local to the national and international.
    ECAST's distributed network model has also promoted independence,
    continuity, and sustainability through changing sociopolitical contexts. In
    this paper, we detail the current state of the ECAST pTA method; share mini
    case studies to illustrate circumstances that prompted new method
    innovations; and offer a vision for further developing and integrating pTA
    into democratic science policy decision-making.

    "Epidemiology is often referred to as the science of public health. However,
    unlike other major sciences, its theoretical foundations are rarely
    articulated. While the idea of epidemiologic theory may seem dry and arcane,
    it is at its core about explaining the people's health. It is about life and
    death. It is about biology and society. It is about ecology and the economy.
    It is about how myriad aspects of people's lives--involving work, dignity,
    desire, love, play, conflict, discrimination, and injustice--become
    literally incorporated biologically into our bodies and manifest in our
    health status, individually and collectively. And it is about essential
    knowledge critical for improving the people's health and minimizing
    inequitable burdens of disease, disability, and death. Woven from a vast
    array of schools of thought, including those in the natural, social, and
    biomedical sciences, epidemiologic theory is a rich tapestry whose time for
    analysis is long overdue. By tracing its history and contours from ancient
    societies on through the development of--and debates within--contemporary
    epidemiology worldwide, Nancy Krieger shows how epidemiologic theory has
    long shaped epidemiologic practice, knowledge, and the politics of public
    health. Outlining an ecosocial theory of disease distribution that situates
    both population health and epidemiologic theory in societal and ecologic
    context, she offers a more holistic picture of how we embody the human
    experience"--Provided by publisher

    Controversial understandings of the coronavirus pandemic have turned data
    visualizations into a battleground. Defying public health officials,
    coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data
    visualizations showing that the government's pandemic response was excessive
    and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic
    visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who
    mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of
    data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical
    policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread
    on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about
    COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro-
    and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar
    data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations
    reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in
    public life.

  abstract: >-
    An account of the Flint water crisis shows that Flint's struggle for safe
    and affordable water is part of a broader struggle for democracy.When Flint,
    Michigan, changed its source of municipal water from Lake Huron to the Flint
    River, Flint residents were repeatedly assured that the water was of the
    highest quality. At the switchover ceremony, the mayor and other officials
    performed a celebratory toast, declaring “Here's to Flint!” and downing
    glasses of freshly treated water. But as we now know, the water coming out
    of residents' taps harbored a variety of contaminants, including high levels
    of lead. In Flint Fights Back, Benjamin Pauli examines the water crisis and
    the political activism that it inspired, arguing that Flint's struggle for
    safe and affordable water was part of a broader struggle for democracy.
    Pauli connects Flint's water activism with the ongoing movement protesting
    the state of Michigan's policy of replacing elected officials in financially
    troubled cities like Flint and Detroit with appointed “emergency
    managers.”Pauli distinguishes the political narrative of the water crisis
    from the historical and technical narratives, showing that Flint activists'
    emphasis on democracy helped them to overcome some of the limitations of
    standard environmental justice frameworks. He discusses the pro-democracy
    (anti–emergency manager) movement and traces the rise of the “water
    warriors”; describes the uncompromising activist culture that developed out
    of the experience of being dismissed and disparaged by officials; and
    examines the interplay of activism and scientific expertise. Finally, he
    explores efforts by activists to expand the struggle for water justice and
    to organize newly mobilized residents into a movement for a radically
    democratic Flint.

    Being concerned with representation, this book is about an idea, a concept,
    a word. It is primarily a conceptual analysis, not a historical study of the
    way in which representative government has evolved, nor yet an empirical
    investigation of the behavior of contemporary representatives or the
    expectations voters have about them. Yet, although the book is about a word,
    it is not about mere words, not merely about words. For the social
    philosopher, for the social scientist, words are not "mere"; they are the
    tools of his trade and a vital part of his subject matter. Since human
    beings are not merely political animals but also language-using animals,
    their behavior is shaped by their ideas. What they do and how they do it
    depends upon how they see themselves and their world, and this in turn
    depends upon the concepts through which they see. Learning what
    "representation" means and learning how to represent are intimately
    connected. But even beyond this, the social theorist sees the world through
    a network of concepts. Our words define and delimit our world in important
    ways, and this is particularly true of the world of human and social things.
    For a zoologist may capture a rare specimen and simply observe it; but who
    can capture an instance of representation (or of power, or of interest)?
    Such things, too, can be observed, but the observation always presupposes at
    least a rudimentary conception of what representation (or power, or
    interest) is, what counts as representation, where it leaves off and some
    other phenomenon begins. Questions about what representation is, or is like,
    are not fully separable from the question of what "representation" means.
    This book approaches the former questions by way of the latter.

  abstract: >-
    Since the late nineteenth century, the "cost of living" has been a prominent
    part of debates about American political economy. By the early twentieth
    century, that prominence had taken a quantitative turn, as businessmen,
    unions, economists, and politicians all turned to cost-of-living statistics
    in their struggle to control and reshape the American economy. Today, the
    continuing power of these statistics is exemplified by the U.S Consumer
    Price Index, whose fluctuations have enormous consequences for economic
    policy and the federal budget (including the allocation of hundreds of
    billions of dollars annually through cost-of-living escalator clauses in
    programs such as Social Security). In this book, Stapleford interweaves
    economic theory with political history to create a novel account of the
    quantitative knowledge that underpins much of American political economy.
    Demonstrating that statistical calculations inevitably require political
    judgments, he reveals what choices were made in constructing and using
    cost-of-living statistics and why those choices matter both for our
    understanding of American history and for contemporary political and
    economic life.

  abstract: >-
    This paper advocates for making epistemic interests a central object of
    philosophical analysis in epistemology and philosophy of science. It is
    argued that the importance of epistemic interests derives from their
    fundamental importance for the notion of objectivity. Epistemic interests
    are defined as individuated by a set of objectives, each of which represents
    a dimension of the search for truth. Among these dimensions, specificity,
    sensitivity, and productivity (the rate at which results are delivered per
    unit of time) are discussed in detail. It is argued that the relevance of
    productivity is often overlooked in debates about the ends and means of
    science. A definition of the objectivity of inquiry is proposed that takes
    the notion of epistemic interest as its starting point.
