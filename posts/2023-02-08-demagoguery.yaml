  abstract: >-
    The idea that science is or should be value-free, and that values are or
    should be formed independently of science, has been under fire by
    philosophers of science for decades. Science and Moral Imagination directly
    challenges the idea that science and values cannot and should not influence
    each other. Matthew J. Brown argues that science and values mutually
    influence and implicate one another, that the influence of values on science
    is pervasive and must be responsibly managed, and that science can and
    should have an influence on our values. This interplay, he explains, must be
    guided by accounts of scientific inquiry and value judgment that are
    sensitive to the complexities of their interactions. Brown presents
    scientific inquiry and value judgment as types of problem-solving practices
    and provides a new framework for thinking about how we might ethically
    evaluate episodes and decisions in science, while offering guidance for
    scientific practitioners and institutions about how they can incorporate
    value judgments into their work. His framework, dubbed "the ideal of moral
    imagination," emphasizes the role of imagination in value judgment and the
    positive role that value judgment plays in science.

  abstract: >-
    In Pollution Is Colonialism Max Liboiron presents a framework for
    understanding scientific research methods as practices that can align with
    or against colonialism. They point out that even when researchers are
    working toward benevolent goals, environmental science and activism are
    often premised on a colonial worldview and access to land. Focusing on
    plastic pollution, the book models an anticolonial scientific practice
    aligned with Indigenous, particularly Métis, concepts of land, ethics, and
    relations. Liboiron draws on their work in the Civic Laboratory for
    Environmental Action Research (CLEAR)—an anticolonial science laboratory in
    Newfoundland, Canada—to illuminate how pollution is not a symptom of
    capitalism but a violent enactment of colonial land relations that claim
    access to Indigenous land. Liboiron's creative, lively, and passionate text
    refuses theories of pollution that make Indigenous land available for
    settler and colonial goals. In this way, their methodology demonstrates that
    anticolonial science is not only possible but is currently being practiced
    in ways that enact more ethical modes of being in the world.

  abstract: >-
    To clarify the proper role of values in science, focusing on controversial
    expert responses to Covid-19, this article examines the status of
    (in)convenient hypotheses. Polarizing cases like health experts downplaying
    mask efficacy to save resources for healthcare workers, or scientists
    dismissing “accidental lab leak” hypotheses in view of potential xenophobia,
    plausibly involve modifying evidential standards for (in)convenient claims.
    Societies could accept that scientists handle (in)convenient claims just
    like nonscientists, and give experts less political power. Or societies
    could hold scientists to a higher bar, by expecting them not to modify
    evidential standards to avoid costs only incidentally tied to error.

  abstract: >-
    Philosophers now commonly reject the value free ideal for science by arguing
    that non-epistemic values, including personal or social values, are
    permissible within the core of scientific research. However, little
    attention has been paid to the normative political consequences of this
    position. This paper explores these consequences and shows how political
    theory is fruitful for proceeding in a world without value-neutral science.
    I draw attention to an oft-overlooked argument employed by proponents of the
    value free ideal I dub the “political legitimacy argument.” This argument
    claims that the value-free ideal follows directly from the foundational
    principles of liberal democracy. If so, then the use of value-laden
    scientific information within democratic decision making would be
    illegitimate on purely political grounds. Despite highlighting this
    unaddressed and important argument, I show how it can be rejected. By
    appealing to deliberative democratic theory, I demonstrate scientific
    information can be value-laden and politically legitimate. The deliberative
    democratic account I develop is well suited for capturing the intuitions of
    many opponents of the value free ideal and points to a new set of questions
    for those interested in values in science.

    Representation is more than a matter of elections and parties. This book
    offers a radical new perspective on the subject. Representation, it argues,
    is all around us, a dynamic practise across societies rather than simply a
    fixed feature of government. At the heart of the argument is the
    straightforward but versatile notion of the representative claim. People
    claim to speak or stand for others in multiple, shifting, and surprising
    patterns. At the same time they offer images of their constituents and
    audiences as artists paint portraits. Who can speak for and about us in this
    volatile world of representations? Which representative claims can have
    democratic legitimacy? The Representative Claim is set to transform our core
    assumptions about what representation is and can be. At a time when
    political representation is widely believed to be in crisis, the book
    provides a timely and critical corrective to conventional wisdom on the
    present and potential future of representative democracy.

  abstract: >-
    A resurgence of Indigenous political cultures, governances and
    nation-building requires generations of Indigenous peoples to grow up
    intimately and strongly connected to our homelands, immersed in our
    languages and spiritualities, and embodying our traditions of agency,
    leadership, decision-making and diplomacy. This requires a radical break
    from state education systems – systems that are primarily designed to
    produce communities of individuals willing to uphold settler colonialism.
    This paper uses Nishnaabeg stories to advocate for a reclamation of land as
    pedagogy, both as process and context for Nishnaabeg intelligence, in order
    to nurture a generation of Indigenous peoples that have the skills,
    knowledge and values to rebuild our nation according to the word views and
    values of Nishnaabeg culture.

    'Young advances a nuanced way of thinking about the problem of political
    exclusion, and its potential remedies... Young's book is a timely
    intervention urging an enlargement of political vision. Inclusion and
    Democracy is an important text, which will rightly generate a deal of
    provocative debate.' -Radical PhilosophyIn the long awaited follow-up to
    Justice and the Politics of Difference, Iris Marion Young- one of the
    world's leading political philosophers- makes major and controversial
    contribution to the debates about democracy in a multicultural society. The
    book considers the ideals of political inclusion and exclusion and
    recommends ways of engaging in democratic politics in a more inclusive way.
    It includes a discussion of class, race and gender bias in democratic
    processes, and asks whether in an era of greater global interaction,
    democratic institutions should become more global
