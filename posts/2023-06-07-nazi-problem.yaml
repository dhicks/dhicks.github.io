  abstract: >-
    Protecting science from politicization is an ongoing concern in contemporary
    society. Yet some political influences on science (e.g., setting public
    funding amounts) are fully legitimate. We need to have a clear account of
    when a political influence is politicization (an illegitimate political
    influence) in order to properly detect and address the problem. I argue in
    this paper that understanding how the space of scientific inquiry is
    distinctive from democratic politics can be the basis for defining
    politicization. Similarities between inquiry and democratic politics have
    long been noted, but there are important differences as well. I describe
    four norms that are importantly distinct for inquiry when compared with
    democratic politics, even if they can be seen as roughly similar. Although
    there are parallels between democratic political norms and norms for
    scientific inquiry, there are crucial differences as well. Eliding these
    differences creates politicization of inquiry. Even as we understand
    scientific inquiry as pursued within society and responsible to society, we
    pursue it in a distinctive space, guided by distinctive norms and practices.

  abstract: >-
    We argue that heritability estimates cannot be used to make informed
    judgments about the populations from which they are drawn. Furthermore,
    predicting changes in heritability from population changes is likely
    impossible, and of limited value. We add that the attempt to separate human
    environments into cultural and non-cultural components does not advance our
    understanding of the environmental multiplier effect.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

  abstract: "Behavior genetics has always been a breeding ground for controversies. From the “criminal chromosome” to the “gay gene,” claims about the influence of genes like these have led to often vitriolic national debates about race, class, and inequality. Many behavior geneticists have encountered accusations of racism and have had their scientific authority and credibility questioned, ruining reputations, and threatening their access to coveted resources. \_ In\_Misbehaving Science,\_Aaron Panofsky traces the field of behavior genetics back to its origins in the 1950s, telling the story through close looks at five major controversies. In the process, Panofsky argues that persistent, ungovernable controversy in behavior genetics is due to the broken hierarchies within the field. All authority and scientific norms are questioned, while the absence of unanimously accepted methods and theories leaves a foundationless field, where disorder is ongoing. Critics charge behavior geneticists with political motivations; champions say they merely follow the data where they lead. But Panofsky shows how pragmatic coping with repeated controversies drives their scientific actions. Ironically, behavior geneticists’ struggles for scientific authority and efforts to deal with the threats to their legitimacy and autonomy have made controversy inevitable—and in some ways essential—to the study of behavior genetics."

  abstract: >-
    Scientists are frequently called upon to “democratize” science, by bringing
    the public into scientific research. One appealing point for public
    involvement concerns the nonepistemic values involved in science. Suppose,
    though, a scientist invites the public to participate in making such
    value-laden determinations but finds that the public holds values the
    scientist considers morally unacceptable. Does the argument for
    democratizing science commit the scientist to accepting the public’s
    objectionable values, or may she veto them? I argue that there are a limited
    set of cases in which scientists can, consistently with a commitment to
    democratized science, set aside the public’s judgments.

    The target article is skeptical of the heritability concept while
    maintaining an old-fashioned point of view about it. As a descriptive
    statistic, it is to be expected that heritability goes up and down in
    different circumstances, but the relationship between heritability
    coefficients and the biological processes that underlie them is difficult to
    specify, and may be impossible in humans.

  abstract: >-
    Feminist epistemologies consider ways in which gender (among other social
    factors) influences knowledge. In this article, I want to consider a
    particular kind of feminist empiricism that has been called feminist radical
    empiricism (where the empiricism, not the feminism, is radical). I am
    particularly interested in this view's treatment of values as empirical, and
    consequently up for revision on the basis of empirical evidence. Proponents
    of this view cite the fact that it allows us to talk about certain things
    such as racial and gender equality as objective facts: not just whether we
    have achieved said equality in our society, but whether we are, in fact, all
    equal. I will raise the concern that the way in which they model the role of
    values in epistemology may be a problematic idealization of the
    open-mindedness of human agents. In some cases, resistance to value-change
    cannot be diagnosed as a failure to respond adequately to evidence. If so,
    the strategy of empirically testing our values that some feminist radical
    empiricists suggest may not be as useful a tool for social change as they
    think.
