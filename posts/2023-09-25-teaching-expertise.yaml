    Social epistemologists often operationalize the task of indirectly assessing
    experts’ trustworthiness to identifying whose beliefs are more reliably true
    on matters in an area of expertise. Not only does this neglect the
    philosophically rich space between belief formation and testimonial
    utterances, it also reduces trustworthiness to reliability. In ethics of
    trust, by contrast, explicitly relational views of trust include things like
    good will and responsiveness. One might think that relational aspects can be
    safely set aside for social epistemology of trust in experts, that such
    considerations may be relevant for personal relationships but not for expert
    trustworthiness. Against these claims I argue for the social-epistemic
    relevance of relational aspects of trust in experts, and to that end I
    discuss three sorts of considerations – responsively positive, neutral, and
    negative factors – that can make a difference for expert trustworthiness.
