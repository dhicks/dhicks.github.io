    Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields
    (“the replication crisis”) have stimulated a movement for open science,
    encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and
    analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency
    (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule
    prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices
    are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this
    paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of
    environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science
    requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical
    evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health
    specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the
    replication crisis extends to environmental public health — or not — seem
    premature. By distinguishing three concepts — reproducibility,
    replicability, and robustness — it is clear that open data initiatives can
    promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote
    replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open
    science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the
    costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.

  abstract: "Background:\_\n        A number of papers by Young and collaborators have criticized epidemiological studies and meta-analyses of air pollution hazards using a graphical method that the authors call a P value plot, claiming to find zero effects, heterogeneity, and P hacking. However, the P value plot method has not been validated in a peer-reviewed publication. The aim of this study was to investigate the statistical and evidentiary properties of this method.\n        Methods:\_\n        A simulation was developed to create studies and meta-analyses with known real effects δδ<math display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>δ</mi></math>, integrating two quantifiable conceptions of evidence from the philosophy of science literature. The simulation and analysis is publicly available and automatically reproduced.\n        Results:\_\n        In this simulation, the plot did not provide evidence for heterogeneity or P hacking with respect to any condition. Under the right conditions, the plot can provide evidence of zero effects; but these conditions are not satisfied in any actual use by Young and collaborators.\n        Conclusion:\_\n        The P value plot does not provide evidence to support the skeptical claims about air pollution hazards made by Young and collaborators."

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

    In its notice outlining the large cut in university funding, the US National
    Institutes of Health seems to draw on a report from a conservative think
    tank that denounces the “political left.”
