    Scientists are called upon by policymakers to provide recommendations on how
    to address climate change. It has been argued that as policy advisors,
    scientists can legitimately make instrumental value judgements
    (recommendations based on deﬁned policy goals), but not categorical value
    judgements (challenge and/or redeﬁne established policy goals), and that to
    do otherwise is to overstep in ways that may threaten their perceived
    trustworthiness. However, whether these types of value judgements aﬀect
    public trust in scientists remains largely untested. We conducted two
    studies (N1 = 367, N2 = 819) to investigate public perceptions of
    trustworthiness of a climate scientist expressing either an instrumental or
    a categorical value judgement. We found no diﬀerence in perceived
    trustworthiness between the two conditions. However, trustworthiness
    perceptions in both studies depended on individuals’ support for the policy
    recommended by the scientist. Our ﬁndings suggest that climate scientists
    should not fear for their overall perceived trustworthiness when making
    categorical value judgments if their opinions are supported by the majority
    of the public.

  abstract: >-
    The terms "objectivity" and "objective" are among the most used yet
    illdefined terms in the philosophy of science and epistemology. Common to
    all the various usages is the rhetorical force of "I endorse this and you
    should too", or to put it more mildly, that one should trust the outcome of
    the objectivity-producing process. The persuasive endorsement and call to
    trust provide some conceptual coherence to objectivity, but the reference to
    objectivity is hopefully not merely an attempt at persuasive endorsement.
    What, in addition to epistemological endorsement, does objectivity carry
    with it? Drawing on recent historical and philosophical work, I articulate
    eight operationally accessible and distinct senses of objectivity. While
    there are links among these senses, providing cohesion to the concept, I
    argue that none of the eight senses is strictly reducible to the others,
    giving objectivity its irreducible complexity. © 2004 Kluwer Academic

    Scientists who perform environmental research on policy-relevant topics face
    challenges when communicating about how values may have influenced their
    research. This study examines how citizens view scientists who publicly
    acknowledge values. Specifically, we investigate whether it matters: if
    citizens share or oppose a scientist’s values, if a scientist’s conclusions
    seem contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and if a
    scientist is assessing the state of the science or making a policy
    recommendation. We conducted two 3x2 factorial design online experiments.
    Experiment 1 featured a hypothetical scientist assessing the state of the
    science on the public-health effects of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), and
    Experiment 2 featured a scientist making a policy recommendation on use of
    BPA. We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and
    whether the scientist’s conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with
    the scientist’s values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects’ values
    aligned with the scientist’s values. We analyzed our data with ordinary
    least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least
    preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived
    credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs
    depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether
    scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether
    scientists make policy recommendations.

  abstract: >-
    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

  abstract: >-
    Given their lack of background knowledge, laypeople require expert help when
    dealing with scientific information. To decide whose help is dependable,
    laypeople must judge an expert’s epistemic trustworthiness in terms of
    competence, adherence to scientific standards, and good intentions. Online,
    this may be difficult due to the often limited and sometimes unreliable
    source information available. To measure laypeople’s evaluations of experts
    (encountered online), we constructed an inventory to assess epistemic
    trustworthiness on the dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence.
    Exploratory (n = 237) and confirmatory factor analyses (n = 345) showed that
    the Muenster Epistemic Trustworthiness Inventory (METI) is composed of these
    three factors. A subsequent experimental study (n = 137) showed that all
    three dimensions of the METI are sensitive to variation in source
    characteristics. We propose using this inventory to measure assignments of
    epistemic trustworthiness, that is, all judgments laypeople make when
    deciding whether to place epistemic trust in–and defer to–an expert in order
    to solve a scientific informational problem that is beyond their
    understanding.

  abstract: >-
    While philosophers of science generally agree that social, political, and
    ethical values can play legitimate roles in science, there is active debate
    over whether scientists should disclosure such values in their public
    communications. This debate depends, in part, on empirical claims about
    whether values disclosures might undermine public trust in science. In a
    previous study, Elliott et al. used an online experiment to test this
    empirical claim. The current paper reports a replication attempt of their
    experiment. Comparing results of the original study and our replication, we
    do not find evidence for a transparency penalty or “shared values” effect,
    but do find evidence that the content of scientific conclusions (whether or
    not a chemical is found to cause harm) might effect perceived
    trustworthiness and that scientists who value public health and disclose
    this value might be perceived as more trustworthy.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

    For centuries scientists have claimed that women are intellectually inferior
    to men and blacks are inferior to whites. Although these claims have been
    contested and corrected for centuries, they still continue to be made.
    Meanwhile, scientists have documented the harm done to women and blacks by
    the publication of such claims. Can anything be done to improve this
    situation? Freedom of research is universally recognized to be of first-rate
    importance. Yet, constraints on that freedom are also universally
    recognized. I consider three of these constraints and argue for tighter
    restrictions on race- and gender-related cognitive differences research on
    their basis.

  abstract: >-
    High-profile political endorsements by scientific publications have become
    common in recent years, raising concerns about backlash against the
    endorsing organizations and scientific expertise. In a preregistered
    large-sample controlled experiment, I randomly assigned participants to
    receive information about the endorsement of Joe Biden by the scientific
    journal Nature during the COVID-19 pandemic. The endorsement message caused
    large reductions in stated trust in Nature among Trump supporters. This
    distrust lowered the demand for COVID-related information provided by
    Nature, as evidenced by substantially reduced requests for Nature articles
    on vaccine efficacy when offered. The endorsement also reduced Trump
    supporters’ trust in scientists in general. The estimated effects on Biden
    supporters’ trust in Nature and scientists were positive, small and mostly
    statistically insignificant. I found little evidence that the endorsement
    changed views about Biden and Trump. These results suggest that political
    endorsement by scientific journals can undermine and polarize public
    confidence in the endorsing journals and the scientific community.
