  abstract: >-
    As dialogue agents become increasingly human-like in their performance, we
    must develop effective ways to describe their behaviour in high-level terms
    without falling into the trap of anthropomorphism. Here we foreground the
    concept of role play. Casting dialogue-agent behaviour in terms of role play
    allows us to draw on familiar folk psychological terms, without ascribing
    human characteristics to language models that they in fact lack. Two
    important cases of dialogue-agent behaviour are addressed this way, namely,
    (apparent) deception and (apparent) self-awareness.
