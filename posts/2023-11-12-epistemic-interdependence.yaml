    Social epistemologists often operationalize the task of indirectly assessing
    experts’ trustworthiness to identifying whose beliefs are more reliably true
    on matters in an area of expertise. Not only does this neglect the
    philosophically rich space between belief formation and testimonial
    utterances, it also reduces trustworthiness to reliability. In ethics of
    trust, by contrast, explicitly relational views of trust include things like
    good will and responsiveness. One might think that relational aspects can be
    safely set aside for social epistemology of trust in experts, that such
    considerations may be relevant for personal relationships but not for expert
    trustworthiness. Against these claims I argue for the social-epistemic
    relevance of relational aspects of trust in experts, and to that end I
    discuss three sorts of considerations – responsively positive, neutral, and
    negative factors – that can make a difference for expert trustworthiness.

    Disrespect for the truth, the rise of conspiracy thinking, and a pervasive
    distrust in experts are widespread features of the post-truth condition in
    current politics and public opinion. Among the many good explanations of
    these phenomena there is one that is only rarely discussed: that something
    is wrong with our deeply entrenched intellectual standards of (i) using our
    own critical thinking without any restriction and (ii) respecting the
    judgment of every rational agent as epistemically relevant. This chapter
    argues that these two Enlightenment principles—the Principle of Unrestricted
    Critical Thinking and the Principle of Democratic Reason—not only conflict
    with what is rationally required from a purely epistemic point of view, but
    also further the spread of conspiracy theories and undermine trust in
    experts. As a result, we should typically defer to experts without using any
    of our own reasons regarding the subject matter
