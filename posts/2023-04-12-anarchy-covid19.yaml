    As my title suggests, I will examine a lesson from Feyerabend’s
    controversial work, Science in a Free Society: that free societies should
    not invest scientific experts with special epistemic or social authority. At
    least, I will ask, should we take this claim from Feyerabend as a lesson? In
    particular, I see Feyerabend’s argument about expert authority as a
    substantive challenge to a central commitment of many philosophers of
    science who reject the ideal of value-free science, a commitment to the
    ineliminability of expert judgment. An argument against this principle is
    articulated clearly and forcefully, if somewhat roughly, in both his Science
    in a Free Society (1978, hereafter SFS) and a related article, “How to
    Defend Society against Science,” originally published in Radical Philosophy
    (1975c, hereafter HDSS).

    Epstein shows the extent to which AIDS research has been a social and
    political phenomenon and how the AIDS movement has transformed biomedical
    research practices through its capacity to garner credibility by novel
    strategies.

  abstract: >-
    No study in the philosophy of science created such controversy in the
    seventies as Paul Feyerabend's Against Method. In this work, Feyerabend
    reviews that controversy, and extends his critique beyond the problem of
    scientific rules and methods, to the social function and direction of
    science today.In the first part of the book, he launches a sustained and
    irreverent attack on the prestige of science in the West. The lofty
    authority of the "expert" claimed by scientists is, he argues, incompatible
    with any genuine democracy, and often merely serves to conceal entrenched
    prejudices and divided opinions with the scientific community itself.
    Feyerabend insists that these can and should be subjected to the arbitration
    of the lay population, whose closes interests they constantly affect-as
    struggles over atomic energy programs so powerfully attest.Calling for far
    greater diversity in the content of education to facilitate democratic
    decisions over such issues, Feyerabend recounts the origin and development
    of his own ideas-successively engaged by Brecht, Ehrenhaft, Popper, Mill and
    Lakatos-in a spirited intellectual self-portrait. Science in a Free Society
    is a striking intervention into one of the most topical debates in
    contemporary culture and politics.

  abstract: >-
    Controversial understandings of the coronavirus pandemic have turned data
    visualizations into a battleground. Defying public health officials,
    coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data
    visualizations showing that the government's pandemic response was excessive
    and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic
    visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who
    mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of
    data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical
    policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread
    on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about
    COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro-
    and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar
    data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations
    reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in
    public life.

  abstract: >-
    It has long been thought that science is our best hope for realizing
    objective knowledge, but that, to deliver on this promise, it must be value
    free. Things are not so simple, however, as recent work in science studies
    makes clear. The contributors to this volume investigate where and how
    values are involved in science, and examine the implications of this
    involvement for ideals of objectivity.
