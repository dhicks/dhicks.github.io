This is a private Signal group, maintained by Dan Hicks and Catherine Stinson. [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)) is a texting and voice call app built around security and privacy. 

To balance privacy of the membership list with security (especially ban evasion), you are not required to use your real name in the group, but you must contact the administrators to join. 

After installing Signal on your device and creating an account as necessary, contact either Dan (US-based, <hicks.daniel.j@gmail.com>) or Catherine (Canada-based, <hello@catherinestinson.ca>), or email <TNGQ@proton.me> (highly secure, mostly monitored by Catherine).
